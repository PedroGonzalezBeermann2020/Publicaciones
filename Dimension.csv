Although a majority of countries display a higher burden in urban areas compared with rural areas, Panama continues to report the highest mortality rate in Central America. Urban areas, such as Panama City, report a high tuberculosis burden, whereas Panama's western region, including the provinces of Chiriquí, Bocas del Toro (both semiurban) and Ngäbe-Bugle (rural), show a lower burden. We aimed to identify highly transmitted Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains within rural and semiurban settings of Panama's western region during a 3-year period (2017, 2019, 2021). We randomly selected 87 M. tuberculosis isolates from a biobank from Panama's western region and analyzed them using allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction and 24-mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR). Our results show only 11.7% (10/85) of M. tuberculosis strains identified as prevalent A-Beijing, B-Haarlem, or C-LAM Strains. We found a low prevalence of A, B, and C M. tuberculosis strains in both rural and semirural settings compared with isolates collected from the Eastern Colon Province. MIRU-VNTR genotyping revealed a high degree of diversity with no clusters with single loci variation of ≥ 2 loci. These results support the notion that tuberculosis prevalence in the rural and semiurban western region of Panama are not due to previously described highly transmitted strains but is influenced instead by other health determinants, including poor health system access and a lack of systematic transmission chain monitoring. For remote rural and semiurban settings, we recommend allocating resources to reinforce efforts to prevent tuberculosis spread.",,,American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,,,,2023-08-21,2023,2023-08-21,2023-10-04,109,4,740-747,Closed,Article,"Acosta, Fermin; Saldaña, Ricardo; Miranda, Sara; Candanedo, Daniela; Sambrano, Dilcia; Morán, Mitchelle; Bejarano, Saily; De Arriba, Yeraldine; Reigosa, Angel; De Dixon, Elizabeth; Atencio, María; Castillo, Ramón; Goodridge, Amador","Acosta, Fermin (Tuberculosis Biomarker Research Unit at Centro de Biologia Celular y Molecular de Enfermedades (CBCME) Instituto de Investigaciones Científicas y Servicios de Alta Tecnología (INDICASAT-AIP), City of Knowledge, Panama City, Panama.); Saldaña, Ricardo (Hospital Materno Infantil José Domingo de Obaldía, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); Miranda, Sara (Tuberculosis Biomarker Research Unit at Centro de Biologia Celular y Molecular de Enfermedades (CBCME) Instituto de Investigaciones Científicas y Servicios de Alta Tecnología (INDICASAT-AIP), City of Knowledge, Panama City, Panama.; Universidad Autónoma de Chiriqui (UNACHI), David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); Candanedo, Daniela (Tuberculosis Biomarker Research Unit at Centro de Biologia Celular y Molecular de Enfermedades (CBCME) Instituto de Investigaciones Científicas y Servicios de Alta Tecnología (INDICASAT-AIP), City of Knowledge, Panama City, Panama.); Sambrano, Dilcia (Tuberculosis Biomarker Research Unit at Centro de Biologia Celular y Molecular de Enfermedades (CBCME) Instituto de Investigaciones Científicas y Servicios de Alta Tecnología (INDICASAT-AIP), City of Knowledge, Panama City, Panama.); Morán, Mitchelle (Tuberculosis Biomarker Research Unit at Centro de Biologia Celular y Molecular de Enfermedades (CBCME) Instituto de Investigaciones Científicas y Servicios de Alta Tecnología (INDICASAT-AIP), City of Knowledge, Panama City, Panama.); Bejarano, Saily (Hospital Materno Infantil José Domingo de Obaldía, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); De Arriba, Yeraldine (Hospital Materno Infantil José Domingo de Obaldía, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); Reigosa, Angel (Hospital Materno Infantil José Domingo de Obaldía, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); De Dixon, Elizabeth (Hospital Materno Infantil José Domingo de Obaldía, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); Atencio, María (Hospital Materno Infantil José Domingo de Obaldía, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); Castillo, Ramón (Programa Regional de Tuberculosis de la Provincia de Chiriquí, Ministerio de Salud, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); Goodridge, Amador (Tuberculosis Biomarker Research Unit at Centro de Biologia Celular y Molecular de Enfermedades (CBCME) Instituto de Investigaciones Científicas y Servicios de Alta Tecnología (INDICASAT-AIP), City of Knowledge, Panama City, Panama.)",,"Acosta, Fermin (City of Knowledge); Saldaña, Ricardo (Hospital Materno Infantil José Domingo de Obaldía, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); Miranda, Sara (City of Knowledge; Autonomous University of Chiriqui); Candanedo, Daniela (City of Knowledge); Sambrano, Dilcia (City of Knowledge); Morán, Mitchelle (City of Knowledge); Bejarano, Saily (Hospital Materno Infantil José Domingo de Obaldía, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); De Arriba, Yeraldine (Hospital Materno Infantil José Domingo de Obaldía, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); Reigosa, Angel (Hospital Materno Infantil José Domingo de Obaldía, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); De Dixon, Elizabeth (Hospital Materno Infantil José Domingo de Obaldía, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); Atencio, María (Hospital Materno Infantil José Domingo de Obaldía, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); Castillo, Ramón (Programa Regional de Tuberculosis de la Provincia de Chiriquí, Ministerio de Salud, David City, Provincia de Chiriquí, Panama.); Goodridge, Amador (City of Knowledge)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163426142,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Although a common group of anamorphic fungi, they have been described up to now only by morphology and their systematic position is unknown. The present study provides a morphological treatise of all known species of Atractilina and Spiropes hyperparasitic on Meliolales, including insights into their systematic position, based on DNA sequences generated here for the first time. The study was conducted, based on 33 herbarium specimens and 23 specimens recently collected in Benin and Panama. The obtained DNA sequence data (28S rDNA and ITS rDNA) of A.parasitica and of two species of Spiropes show systematic placements in the Dothideomycetes and Leotiomycetes, respectively. The sequence data of the two Spiropes spp. do not group together. Moreover, the anamorph-teleomorph connection between Atractilinaparasitica and Malacariameliolicola, a pseudothecioid fungus, is confirmed. Three species in the genus Spiropes are proposed as new to science, namely S.angylocalycis, S.carpolobiae and S.croissantiformis. Four species are reported for Benin for the first time, three species for Panama and one species for mainland America. Atractilina and Spiropes are currently two genera with highly heterogeneous species and they might have to be split in the future, once the taxonomic concepts are validated by morphology and molecular sequence data.","We are grateful to the University of Parakou and the University of Abomey-Calavi, Benin, for the support and facilities made available for this study.

Additions to and a review of the genus Leucotrichia (Trichoptera, Hydroptilidae) in Panama","Prior to 2016, three species of caddisflies in the genus Leucotrichia (Trichoptera: Hydroptilidae) were known from Panama. Subsequently, one new species and four new country records were added to Panama's fauna. Herein, four new species are described (Leucotrichiacortadera sp. nov., L.holzenthali sp. nov., L.luma sp. nov., L.ruiteri sp. nov.) and two new country records added for Panama (L.botosaneanui Flint, 1996, L.hispida Thomson & Holzenthal, 2015). The resulting total of 14 species makes Panama the most species-rich country for this genus. Panama's species assemblage is most similar to Costa Rica and Mexico. However, the similarities among faunas in all these countries is very low (< 35%). Thus, more new country records are possible with additional collecting. Recent collections (2015-2021) of new caddisfly species and country records in this genus were effected primarily by use of Malaise traps. Our collections also evidenced multiple species from the same collecting site, with seven species each found in both lowland and mid-altitude sites. Investigation of the distribution of Leucotrichia species with altitude reveals a preference by several species for higher altitude locations. Additional Malaise trap collections over extended time periods are needed to verify the validity of all observations and preliminary conclusions made to date.","First, we would like to acknowledge the impact of Dr. Ralph Holzenthal on each of the authors at both a personal and professional level.

5209,pub.1145715277,10.7717/peerj.12901,35198262,PMC8860067,Drivers of phenotypic divergence in a Mesoamerican highland bird,"Animals derive their coloration from a variety of pigments as well as non-pigmentary structural features. One of the most widespread types of pigments are carotenoids, which are used by all invertebrate taxa and most vertebrate orders to generate red, pink, orange and yellow coloration. Despite their widespread use by diverse animal groups, animals obligately obtain carotenoid pigments from diet. Carotenoid-based coloration is therefore modulated by evolutionary and ecological processes that affect the acquisition and deposition of these pigments into tegumentary structures. The Flame-colored Tanager (Piranga bidentata) is a highland songbird in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae) that is distributed from Mexican sierras through Central America up to western Panama. While female plumage throughout its entire range is predominantly yellow, males exhibit a noticeable split in ventral plumage color, which is bright orange on the West slope and the Tres Marias Islands and blood red in Eastern Mexico and Central America. We used Multiple Regression on Matrices (MRM) to evaluate the relative contributions of geographic distance, climate and genetic distance on color divergence and body differences between geographically disjunct populations. We found that differentiation in carotenoid plumage coloration was mainly explained by rainfall differences between disjunct populations, whereas body size differences was best explained by variation in the annual mean temperature and temperature of coldest quarter. These results indicate that climate is a strong driver of phenotypic divergence in Piranga bidentata.","The research was supported by PAPIIT/DGAPA, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) through a grant to Blanca E.

For effective elimination, it is key that malaria foci and areas of high transmission are identified in a timely manner. Here, we study malaria transmission records for the 2015-2022 period, a time when cases have increased by a factor of ten. Using several methods to study spatial and spatiotemporal malaria confirmed case clusters at the level of localities, including LISA and scan, we found that cases are clustered across indigenous villages located within the autonomous indigenous regions of Ngäbe-Buglé, Guna Yala, and Embera, with the latter on the eastern border of Panama (with Colombia). We discuss the different factors that might be shaping the marked increase in malaria transmission associated with these clusters, which include an inflow of malaria-exposed migrating populations hoping to reach the USA, insufficient health services, and the lack of culturally sensitive actionable tools to reduce malaria exposure among the ethnically diverse and impoverished indigenous populations of Panama.",We thank Gumercindo Lorenzo and Emily Garcia from INEC for the statistical consolidation of the indigenous population of Panama.

Therefore, the LD50 was determined by intravenous injection in 2.9 mg/kg and the venom of T. championi was separated using a HPLC system and their fractions were tested for biological activities in mice to identify the most toxic fractions to mammals. In addition, the venom fractions were also tested against invertebrates to look for insect-specific toxin peptides. The most toxic fractions were analyzed by MS/MS spectrometry. The primary structures of T. championi venom peptides with the most relevant activity were obtained, and the primary structure of one of most neurotoxic peptides was found at least in other four species of Tityus from Panama. This neurotoxin is quite important to be used as a protein target to be neutralized if developing antivenoms against the sting of this Panamanian scorpion or other relevant species of genera Tityus in the country.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Pristimantisgretathunbergae sp. nov. is a sister species to the allopatric P.erythropleura-penelopus group from northern Colombia with a mtDNA sequence divergence of > 4.4% at 16S and > 14.6% at COI. Its closest congener in sympatry is P.cruentus that differs by a large sequence divergence of > 9.6% in 16S mtDNA and 19.0% at COI, and from which it differs also by ventral and groin coloration, unusually prominent black eyes, a contrasting light upper lip, commonly a single conical to spine-like tubercle on the upper eyelid, and a larger head. While the habitat continuity at most sites in eastern Panama is moderate, habitats in central Panama are severely fragmented. Cerro Chucantí and the surrounding Maje Mountains are highly threatened by rapid deforestation and replaced by plantations and cattle pastures. Thus, investigations on the ecology of the new species and its population status, especially at the type locality, are highly recommended. As a flagship species, this new frog can help to preserve the Chucantí cloud forest including several recently described species known only from this isolated area in eastern Panama.","We thank Luis DeLeon, Jesús Pérez, Juan Zarzavilla, Yorlis Cáceres, Hugo Martínez, and Gilberto Torres for field assistance, and Guido Berguido for his support during our stay at the Chucantí private reserve.

Objective: To determine the association between the pathologies of the mental sphere and the perceptions of fear and exaggeration transmitted by the media with respect to COVID-19 in Latin America.
Methodology: The present study has an analytical cross-sectional design that is based on a validated survey to measure fear and exaggeration transmitted by the media and other sources (Cronbach's α: 0.90). We surveyed more than 6,000 people, originally from 12 Latin American countries, who associated this perceived exaggeration with stress, depression, and anxiety (measured through DASS-21, Cronbach's α: 0.96).
Results: Social networks (40%) or television (34%) were perceived as the sources that exaggerate the magnitude of the events. In addition, television (35%) and social networks (28%) were perceived as the sources that generate much fear. On the contrary, physicians and health personnel are the sources that exaggerated less (10%) or provoked less fear (14%). Through a multivariate model, we found a higher level of global perception that was associated with whether the participant was older (p = 0.002), had severe or more serious anxiety (p = 0.033), or had stress (p = 0,037). However, in comparison with Peru (the most affected country), there was a lower level of perception in Chile (p < 0.001), Paraguay (p = 0.001), Mexico (p < 0.001), Ecuador (p = 0.001), and Costa Rica (p = 0.042). All of them were adjusted for gender and for those having severe or major depression.
Conclusion: There exists an association between some mental pathologies and the perception that the media does not provide moderate information.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2023-05-17,2023,2023-05-17,,14,,1037450,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mejia, Christian R.; Aveiro-Róbalo, Telmo Raul; Torales, Luciana Daniela Garlisi; Hidalgo, Verónica Alejandra Alejandra Castro; Valeriano, Jhino; Ibarra-Montenegro, David Alfonso; Conde-Escobar, Aram; Sánchez-Soto, Fernanda; Canaviri-Murillo, Yuliana; Oliva-Ponce, María; Serna-Alarcón, Victor; Vilela-Estrada, Martín A.; Arias-Chávez, Dennis","Mejia, Christian R.

4517,pub.1137032430,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112226,33848739,,High sensitivity of invertebrate detritivores from tropical streams to different pesticides,"Freshwater organisms are often sensitive to pesticides, but their sensitivity varies across different taxa and with pesticide type and action mode, as shown by multiple acute toxicity tests. Such variability hampers predictions about how freshwater ecosystems may be altered by pesticide toxicity, which is especially critical for understudied areas of the world such as the tropics. Furthermore, there is little information about the sensitivity of some organisms that are key components of stream food webs; this is the case of litter-feeding detritivorous invertebrates, which contribute to the fundamental process of litter decomposition. Here, we examined the sensitivity of three common detritivores [Anchytarsus sp. (Coleoptera: Ptilodactylidae), Hyalella sp. (Amphipoda: Hyalellidae) and Lepidostoma sp. (Trichoptera: Lepidostomatidae)] to three pesticides commonly used (the insecticides bifenthrin and chlorpyrifos and the fungicide chlorothalonil) using acute (48 or 96 h) toxicity tests. Our study demonstrates that common-use pesticides provoke the mortality of half their populations at concentrations of 0.04-2.7 μg L-1. We found that all species were sensitive to the three pesticides, with the highest sensitivity found for chlorpyrifos. Additionally, we used the approach of species sensitivity distributions (SSD) to compare our study species with Daphnia magna and other temperate and tropical invertebrates. We found that the study species were among the most sensitive species to chlorpyrifos and chlorothalonil. Our results suggest that tropical detritivores merit special attention in ecological risk assessment of pesticides and highlight the need for accurate ecotoxicological information from ecologically relevant species in the tropics.","We thank the Panamanian Ministry of Environment for their authorization to carry out the study at the PILA Station; Brenda Checa from the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA), who led the RLA7019 Project, funded by the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA), which supported training with experts; Anyi Tuñon, Bert Kolhmann, Francisco Quesada, Jenny Bermúdez, Meyer Guevara, Milexi Molinar, Monika Springer, Silvia Echeverría-Sáenz, Tomás A.

A total of 23 samples were extracted using immunoaffinity columns and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a fluorescence detector (FLD) and post-column photochemical derivatization. For the method used, the detection limits were lower than 0.25 μg/Kg for aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2) and ochratoxin A and 9.35 μg/Kg for zearalenone; the limits of quantification were between 0.25 and 18.75 μg/Kg, respectively. Of the samples analyzed, all of the paddy rice samples were positive for at least one of the mycotoxins studied, zearalenone being the one found with the highest incidence (90.91%); for the polished rice samples, the mycotoxin with the highest incidence was zearalenone (50%), although in concentrations lower than those established in European legislation (100 μg/Kg).

However, there is little information about the potential effects of agriculture on the functioning of tropical streams, which is essential if we are to assess the condition and ecological integrity of these ecosystems. We conducted a litter decomposition experiment in streams within a tropical catchment, which were subjected to different degrees of agricultural influence: low (protected area, PA), medium (buffer area, BA) and high (agricultural area, AA). We quantified decomposition rates of litter enclosed within coarse-mesh and fine-mesh bags, which allowed the distinction of microbial and detritivore-mediated decomposition pathways. We used litter of three riparian species representing a gradient in litter quality (Alnus acuminata > Ficus insipida > Quercus bumelioides), and examined detritivore assemblages through the contents of litterbags and benthic samples. We found that the increasing agricultural influence promoted microbial decomposition, probably due to nutrient-mediated stimulation; and inhibited detritivore-mediated and total decomposition because of reduced detritivore numbers, most likely caused by pesticides and sedimentation. Effects were evident for Alnus and Ficus, but not for Quercus, which was barely decomposed across the gradient. Our study provides key evidence about the impact of agriculture on tropical stream ecosystem functioning, which is associated to changes in stream assemblages and may have far-reaching repercussions for global biochemical cycles.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Here, we investigate the association between environmental changes and spatio-temporal ACL transmission in the Republic of Panamá (1980-2012). We employ a macroecological approach, where patterns of variation in ACL incidence at the spatially coarse-grained scale of health areas are studied considering factors linked to the ecology of ACL transmission. We specifically study impacts of climatic variability, measured by the different phases of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), within diverse ecosystems and sand fly (Diptera: Psychodidae) vector species, as well as heterogeneous local climatic patterns, deforestation, population growth rates, and changes in social marginalization. We found that over the study period, patterns of ACL incidence: (i) were asynchronous with clusters changing from east to west of the Panamá Canal, (ii) trends increased in the west, and decreased or remained nearly constant in the east, independent of human population growth, (iii) generally increased in years following El Niño, and (iv) decreased as forest cover increased. We found no significant association between changes in socio-economic indicators and ACL transmission. Regarding vector abundance and presence, we found that studies had been biased to locations east of the Panamá canal, and that, in general, the abundance of dominant vector species decreased during the cold phase of ENSO. Finally, our results indicate that a macroecological approach is useful to understand heterogeneities related to environmental change impacts on ACL transmission.","Miss Junko Sakemoto provided valuable administrative support at Nagasaki University.

Our goal was to identify environmental predictors of tick burdens on dogs and tick-borne infectious agents in dog-derived ticks in the Chiriquí Province of western Panama to draw inferences about spatio-temporal variation in human risk to tick-borne diseases. We used a model-selection approach to test the relative importance of elevation, human population size, vegetative cover, and change in landuse on patterns of tick parasitism on dogs. We collected 2074 ticks, representing four species (Rhipicephalus sanguineus, R. microplus, Amblyomma ovale, and Ixodes boliviensis) from 355 dogs. Tick prevalence ranged from 0 to 74% among the sites we sampled, and abundance ranged from 0 to 20.4 ticks per dog with R. sanguineus s.l. being the most commonly detected tick species (97% of all ticks sampled). Whereas elevation was the best single determinant of tick prevalence and abundance on dogs, the top models also included predictor variables describing vegetation cover and landuse change. Specifically, low-elevation areas associated with decreasing vegetative cover were associated with highest tick occurrence on dogs, potentially because of the affinity of R. sanguineus for human dwellings. Although we found low prevalence of tick-borne pathogen genera (two Rickettsia-positive ticks, no R. rickettsia or Ehrlichia spp.) in our study, all of the tick species we collected from dogs are known vectors of zoonotic pathogens. In areas where epidemiological surveillance infrastructure is limited, field-based assessments of acarological risk can be useful and cost-effective tools in efforts to identify high-risk environments for tick-transmitted pathogens.","We are indebted to the many residents of Chiriquí who participated in this Project by allowing tick collection from their dogs.

We report an 83-year-old man from Chiriquí, Western Panama, with crusted skin lesions covering tumorous masses resembling Bowen's disease of the skin on the dorsum of his right hand. Fungal cultures were obtained on different nutrient media from disinfected superficial skin scrapings and fragments taken from a deep skin biopsy. Deep skin biopsy showed the presence of globose, dark fungal cells in the upper and lower dermis, sometimes in abscesses or giant cells, indicating chromoblastomycosis. All fungal fragments plated on nutrient media yielded colonies of Chaetomium funicola which was identified based on morphological observations and molecular sequence data of large ribosomal subunit rDNA. Treatment with fluconazole was ineffective. Further treatments could not be applied because of the patient's advanced age, low compliance, and limited resources in a rural, tropical environment. For the first time, C. funicola is confirmed as an opportunistic fungus causing superficial and deep cutaneous lesions. Up to now, the only known clinical record of this species is a tentative identification as an agent of deep mycosis.","We thank M. Wolter, Frankfurt/Main, for collaboration in histopathology.

Asterina alloplecti on Alloplectus ichtyoderma (Gesneriaceae) differs from other Asterina on Gesneriaceae by its stalked appressoria and host relationship. Asterina compsoneurae on Compsoneura sprucei (Myristicaceae) can be distinguished from other members of Asterina on Myristicaceae by its larger ascomata, larger, prominently spinose ascospores and host relationship. New records for Panama are Asterina corallopoda from a new host plant species (Solanum trizygum, Solanaceae), A. diplopoda, A. ekmanii from a new host plant species (Gonzalagunia rudis, Rubiaceae), A. siphocampyli from a new host plant genus and species (Burmeistera vulgaris, Campanulaceae) and A. styracina from a new host-plant species (Styrax argenteus, Styracaceae). This study increases the number of species of Asterina known for Panama from 12 to 19 and the number of Asterinaceae from 14 to 21. Asterina corallopoda, A. diplopoda, A. ekmanii, A. siphocampyli and A. styracina are illustrated for the first time.

Biogeographic work on Central American freshwater fishes has been largely descriptive and regional, and lacked a broader synthesis. Here we use parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) to elucidate faunistic relationships between major drainages and to delineate areas of endemism. We then perform a Brooks parsimony analysis (BPA) on the resulting areas. The PAE recovered a primary division between four Pacific and six Atlantic slope areas of endemism. In contrast, the BPA recovered two Central American geographic clades, one sharing a history with North America and the other with South America. Fish diversity is uneven across Central America, with greater diversity in areas adjacent to the more species-rich regions of North and South America. In northern and nuclear Central America, the paucity of ostariophysan freshwater fishes such as catfishes and characins (groups that dominate adjacent regions) contrasts with high species richness of poeciliids and cichlids. Results of this study are consistent with Myer's hypothesis that poeciliids and cichlids dispersed to Northern or Nuclear Middle America early in the Cenozoic, long before the Plio-Pleistocene rise of the Isthmus of Panama.","We wish to thank Lee Shelton for his help collecting distributional data from southern Central America and Tiago Carvalho for discussions and interpretations of the PAE and BPA and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on the manuscript.

In this study, we used female adult Wistar rats to examine the effects of antagonizing the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor in phasic and tonic pain processes. All the rats underwent stereotaxic surgery for cortical cannula implantation and after at least one week of recovery, rats performed behavioral tests. For evaluating the effects of drugs on motor coordination rats were tested in the rotarod apparatus. Moreover, rats were evaluated in the paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to a noxious thermal stimulus. Furthermore, rats were tested in the formalin-pain test. Rats that received the NR2B antagonist Ro 25-6981 before and after formalin injection showed significantly reduced pain responses in the formalin test, as compared with female control rats (p<0.05). In contrast, no differences among groups were found in the phasic pain test (Hargreaves) and the rotarod test.

The new species can be distinguished from its congeners occurring in the region by a combination of the following characters: (1) phalangeal reduction in thumb; (2) SVL (females only) (35.1-50.1; n=13), HW/SVL (0.23-0.34; n=59), EYND/HW (0.27-0.39; n=60), TIBL/SVL (0.41-0.56; n=58), and HAL/SVL (0.22-0.28; n=49); (3) dorsal color pattern with green or yellow background and extensive dark olive blotches forming transversal bands or mottling; (4) advertisement call duration 176-235 ms with 19-34 pulses, average pulse rate 131.69 pulses/s, and dominant frequency 2 422.50-2 606.50 Hz. The new species is nested within the Central American clade of Atelopus. The minimum Kimura-2-parameter (K2P) genetic divergence between Atelopus fronterizo sp. nov. and its most phylogenetically similar congeners ( A. certus and A. glyphus) is >2.6% for 16S and >4.9% for COI (Table 1). The phylogenetic relationship is strongly supported by ultrafast bootstrap values for the maximum-likelihood trees of both genetic markers (16S, 96; COI, 100, Figure 1A). Bayesian analysis of the concatenated sequences resulted in a tree with similar topology and high posterior probability support (0.99; Supplementary Figure S1). In addition, haplotype networks inferred from COI and 16S (Supplementary Figure S2) showed a well-separated clade containing the new species (two for COI, four for 16S). The number of mutational steps between haplotypes for the new species samples is very low (1-4 in 16S; one in COI), and the minimum number of mutational steps from the nearest species is nine for 16S (distance to A. certus) and 28 for COI (distance to A. glyphus).","This work was supported by the Sistema Nacional de Investigación (SNI) of SENACYT, Panama, and M.V. received institutional support from Palacky University",,动物学研究,,,Animal Distribution; Animals; Bufonidae; Panama; Phylogeny; Species Specificity,2021,2021,,2021,42,3,272-279,All OA; Gold,Article,"Veselý, Milan; Batista, Abel","Veselý, Milan (Department of Zoology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Palacky University, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic); Batista, Abel (Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí, Ciudad Universitaria El Cabrero David, Chiriquí 427, Panamá; Asociación ADOPTA el Bosque Panamá, Gamboa 119x, Panamá; Fundación Los Naturalistas, David, Chiriquí 426-01459, Panamá)","Batista, Abel (Autonomous University of Chiriqui; Asociación ADOPTA el Bosque Panamá, Gamboa 119x, Panamá; Fundación Los Naturalistas, David, Chiriquí 426-01459, Panamá)","Veselý, Milan (Palacký University, Olomouc); Batista, Abel (Autonomous University of Chiriqui; Asociación ADOPTA el Bosque Panamá, Gamboa 119x, Panamá; Fundación Los Naturalistas, David, Chiriquí 426-01459, Panamá)",4,4,0.26,1.32,https://doi.org/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2020.319,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136675153,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3104 Evolutionary Biology; 3105 Genetics,

Only three of these represent species from the neotropics. In Panama, Laccaria is abundant in monodominant Oreomunnea mexicana (Juglandaceae) forests based on sporocarps and environmental sequencing of roots. This study uses a combination of morphological and phylogenetic evidence to document up to seven species of Laccaria from these forests, one previously described, three described as new, and three requiring more data before being formally described. Molecular data used for phylogenetic analysis include the nuclear ribosomal ITS and 28S regions, along with TEF1 and RPB2. Laccaria stellata, has previously been reported from O. mexicana cloud forests of Panama. Laccaria dallingii sp. nov., L. nitrophila sp. nov., and L. fortunensis sp. nov. are described as new based on morphology and phylogenetic analysis of multiple collections. A taxon referred to as ""PAN sp3"" is resolved sister to L. stellata. Phylogenetic analysis also resolved two separate clades of Panamanian Laccaria as sister to L. roseoalbescens, a species previously described from Mexico. These three taxa are not described in this paper as there is too little material from which to make effective morphological descriptions even though their placement in phylogenetic analysis identify them as being unique. Ecologically, all described species except for L. fortunensis were amplified from O. mexicana ectomycorrhizal root tips. L. nitrophila was one of the most recovered species from the roots of O. mexicana in a previous study, and it has been shown to respond positively to long term nitrogen addition.

Archaeologically, it belongs to a wider Isthmo-Colombian Area. Today, seven indigenous ethnic groups account for 12.3% of Panama's population. Five speak Chibchan languages and are characterized by low genetic diversity and a high level of differentiation. In addition, no evidence of differential structuring between maternally and paternally inherited genes has been reported in isthmian Chibchan cultural groups. Recent data have shown that 83% of the Panamanian general population harbour mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) of Native American ancestry. Considering differential male/female mortality at European contact and multiple degrees of geographical and genetic isolation over the subsequent five centuries, the Y-chromosome Native American component is expected to vary across different geographic regions and communities in Panama. To address this issue, we investigated Y-chromosome variation in 408 modern males from the nine provinces of Panama and one indigenous territory (the comarca of Kuna Yala). In contrast to mtDNA data, the Y-chromosome Native American component (haplogroup Q) exceeds 50% only in three populations facing the Caribbean Sea: the comarca of Kuna Yala and Bocas del Toro province where Chibchan languages are spoken by the majority, and the province of Colón where many Kuna and people of mixed indigenous-African-and-European descent live. Elsewhere the Old World component is dominant and mostly represented by western Eurasian haplogroups, which signal the strong male genetic impact of invaders. Sub-Saharan African input accounts for 5.9% of male haplotypes. This reflects the consequences of the colonial Atlantic slave trade and more recent influxes of West Indians of African heritage. Overall, our findings reveal a local evolution of the male Native American ancestral gene pool, and a strong but geographically differentiated unidirectional sex bias in the formation of local modern Panamanian populations.","This research is part of the University of Pavia strategic theme &quot;Towards a governance model for international migration: an interdisciplinary and diachronic perspective&quot; (MIGRAT-IN-G) and received support from the Instituto Conmemorativo Gorgas de Estudios de la Salud (to JM, JMP), the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation (to UAP, NM, SRW), the Italian Ministry of the University: Progetti di Ricerca Interesse Nazionale 2012 (to AA, AT and OS) and Progetti Futuro in Ricerca 2012 (RBFR126B8I) (to AO, AA).

RPB2, β-TUB). The new species are described as: Hermatomyces bifurcatus, H. constrictus, H. megasporus, H. sphaericoides, and H. verrucosus spp. nov. Previously described species such as H. sphaericus and H. tucumanensis were identified among the studied specimens. The new combination, H. reticulatus, is made for Subicularium reticulatum based on examination of the holotype and fresh collections. Hermatomyces subiculosus, originally described from Thailand, is reduced to synonymy with H. reticulatus; H. tectonae is synonymized under H. sphaericus based on morphological and molecular evidence; and H. chiangmaiensis and H. thailandicus are considered later synonyms of H. krabiensis and H. indicus, respectively. The type material of Scyphostroma mirum was found to be conspecific with H. tucumanensis and, therefore, the generic name Hermatomyces should be conserved or protected against the older name Scyphostroma and the binomial H. tucumanensis against S. mirum. Sixteen species of Hermatomyces are recognized, their distinctive characteristics are highlighted in line drawings and a key is provided for their identification. The peculiar morphology and consistent phylogeny of new and previously known Hermatomyces species supports the recognition of the recently introduced monotypic family Hermatomycetaceae as a well delimited monophyletic taxon within the order Pleosporales.","We are grateful to Markéta Šandová (PRM), Shannon Dominick (BPI) and Lee Davis (K(M)) for the loan of specimens in their care.

We performed Bayesian and Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography analyses and found genetic differences between the three groups, suggesting the existence of two cryptic species (E. fulgens and E. viridiceps) and one phenotypically differentiated species (E. spectabilis).

Several basic phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) have been previously characterized from B. asper venom, but few studies have been carried out with its acidic isoforms. In addition, since snake venom is a rich source of bioactive substances, it is necessary to investigate the biotechnological potential of its components. In this context, this study aimed to carry out the biochemical characterization of PLA2 isoforms isolated from B. asper venom and to evaluate the antiparasitic potential of these toxins. The venom and key fractions were subjected to different chromatographic steps, obtaining nine PLA2s, four acidic ones (BaspAc-I, BaspAc-II, BaspAc-III and BaspAc-IV) and five basic ones (BaspB-I, BaspB-II, BaspB-III, BaspB-IV and BaspB-V). The isoelectric points of the acidic PLA2s were also determined, which presented values ranging between 4.5 and 5. The findings indicated the isolation of five unpublished isoforms, four Asp49-PLA, corresponding to the group of acidic isoforms, and one Lys49-PLA2-like. Acidic PLA2s catalyzed the degradation of all substrates evaluated; however, for the basic PLA2s, there was a preference for phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. The antiparasitic potential of the toxins was evaluated, and the acidic PLA2s demonstrated action against the epimastigote forms of T. cruzi and promastigote forms of L. infantum, while the basic PLA2s BaspB-II and BaspB-IV showed activity against P. falciparum. The results indicated an increase of up to 10 times in antiplasmodial activity, when the Asp49-PLA2 and Lys49-PLA2 were associated with one another, denoting synergistic action between these PLA2 isoforms. These findings correspond to the first report of synergistic antiplasmodial action for svPLA2s, demonstrating that these molecules may be important targets in the search for new antiparasitic agents.","The authors express their gratitude to Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) Fundação Rondônia de Amparo ao Desenvolvimento das Ações Científicas e Tecnológicas e à Pesquisa do Estado de Rondônia (FAPERO) from Brazil, as well as the National Research Incentive Program (PRONII-229/2011) and to “Programa de repatriacion y radicación de investigadores” of the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT) from Paraguay for the financial support.

Some individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are in the early phase of the disease and subsequently progress through the AD continuum. Although neuroimaging biomarkers could be used for the accurate and early diagnosis of preclinical AD, the findings in SCD samples have been heterogeneous. This study established the morphological differences in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings between individuals with SCD and those without cognitive impairment based on a clinical sample of patients defined according to SCD-Initiative recommendations. Moreover, we investigated baseline structural changes in the brains of participants who remained stable or progressed to mild cognitive impairment or dementia.
METHODS: This study included 309 participants with SCD and 43 healthy controls (HCs) with high-quality brain MRI at baseline. Among the 99 subjects in the SCD group who were followed clinically, 32 progressed (SCDp) and 67 remained stable (SCDnp). A voxel-wise statistical comparison of gray and white matter (WM) volume was performed between the HC and SCD groups and between the HC, SCDp, and SCDnp groups. XTRACT ATLAS was used to define the anatomical location of WM tract damage. Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses were performed to determine brain volumetric differences. White matter lesion (WML) burden was established in each group.
RESULTS: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis revealed that the SCD group exhibited gray matter atrophy in the middle frontal gyri, superior orbital gyri, superior frontal gyri, right rectal gyrus, whole occipital lobule, and both thalami and precunei. Meanwhile, ROI analysis revealed decreased volume in the left rectal gyrus, bilateral medial orbital gyri, middle frontal gyri, superior frontal gyri, calcarine fissure, and left thalamus. The SCDp group exhibited greater hippocampal atrophy (p < 0.001) than the SCDnp and HC groups on ROI analyses. On VBM analysis, however, the SCDp group exhibited increased hippocampal atrophy only when compared to the SCDnp group (p < 0.001). The SCD group demonstrated lower WM volume in the uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, and callosum forceps than the HC group. However, no significant differences in WML number (p = 0.345) or volume (p = 0.156) were observed between the SCD and HC groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The SCD group showed brain atrophy mainly in the frontal and occipital lobes. However, only the SCDp group demonstrated atrophy in the medial temporal lobe at baseline. Structural damage in the brain regions was anatomically connected, which may contribute to early memory decline.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,No funding was received for this work.,NeuroImage Clinical,,,"Humans; Male; Female; Cognitive Dysfunction; Aged; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Brain; Neuroimaging; Gray Matter; White Matter; Alzheimer Disease; Disease Progression; Aged, 80 and over",2024-05-10,2024,2024-05-10,2024,42,,103615,All OA; Gold,Article,"Riverol, Mario; Ríos-Rivera, Mirla M.; Imaz-Aguayo, Laura; Solis-Barquero, Sergio M.; Arrondo, Carlota; Montoya-Murillo, Genoveva; Villino-Rodríguez, Rafael; García-Eulate, Reyes; Domínguez, Pablo; Fernández-Seara, Maria A.","Riverol, Mario (Department of Neurology, Clínica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona 31008, Navarra, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Navarra, Pamplona 31008, Navarra, Spain); Ríos-Rivera, Mirla M.

The hyper-diverse genus Lepanthes from Neotropical cloud forest includes over 1200 species and many recent, explosive diversifications that have resulted in poorly supported nodes and morphological convergence across clades. Here, we assess the performance of 446 nuclear-plastid-mitochondrial markers derived from an anchored hybrid enrichment approach (AHE) coupled with coalescence- and species network-based inferences to resolve phylogenetic relationships and improve species recognition in the Lepanthes horrida species group. In addition to using orchid-specific probes to increase enrichment efficiency, we improved gene tree resolution by extending standard angiosperm targets into adjacent exons. We found high topological discordance among individual gene trees, suggesting that hybridization/polyploidy may have promoted speciation in the lineage via formation of new hybrid taxa. In addition, we identified ten loci with the highest phylogenetic informativeness values from these genomes. Most previous phylogenetic sampling in the Pleurothallidinae relies on two regions (ITS and matK), therefore, the evaluation of other markers such as those shown here may be useful in future phylogenetic studies in the orchid family. Coalescent-based species tree estimation methods resolved the phylogenetic relationships of the L. horrida species group. The resolution of the phylogenetic estimations was improved with the inclusion of extended anchor targets. This approach produced longer loci with higher discriminative power. These analyses also disclosed two undescribed species, L. amicitiae and L. genetoapophantica, formally described here, which are also supported by morphology. Our study demonstrates the utility of combined genomic evidence to disentangle phylogenetic relationships at very shallow levels of the tree of life, and in clades showing convergent trait evolution. With a fully resolved phylogeny, is it possible to disentangle traits evolving in parallel or convergently across these orchid lineages such as flower color and size from diagnostic traits such as the shape and orientation of the lobes of the petals and lip.","Acknowledgements We acknowledge the Ministerio de Ambiente y Energía (MINAE) and Sistema Nacional de Áreas de Conservación (SINAC) of Costa Rica for issuing the scientific permits 026-2011-SINAC, 073-2012-SINAC, R-SINAC-DE-077, and SINAC-SE-GASP-PI-R-019-2015 for collecting wild plant material.

These habitats may also be stratified in vertical space, for example, root structures occur at ground level and below, whereas epiphytes occur above-ground. Canopy habitat is utilized by a diversity of amphibians, but canopy habitat may only be viable in the wet season when epiphytes and surfaces are sufficiently saturated. Here, we examine how the provisioning of microhabitats and structures by LOTs influence the horizontal, vertical, and seasonal distribution patterns of phytotelmata-breeding poison frogs. We conducted ground-to-canopy surveys over 4 years, constituting 6 seasons, in Panama and used mark-recapture techniques on a population of the yellow-bellied poison frog, Andinobates fulguritus. We found that A. fulguritus migrated vertically, tracking seasonal rainfall, and displayed strong philopatry to individual trees. Furthermore, A. fulguritus almost exclusively inhabited the largest trees at the study location, which provided disproportionately high-quality microhabitats and epiphytes compared to other trees. LOTs, and specifically Anacardium excelsum at our site, appear to serve as keystone structures with high conservation value due to their provisioning of unique habitats. We conclude that the distribution of A. fulguritus is defined vertically by the stratification of arboreal microhabitat resources, horizontally by the presence of LOTs providing the resources, and temporally by the seasonal viability of the resources.","Financial support was generously provided by the American Museum of Natural History’s Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Grant and the American Philosophical Society’s Lewis and Clark Fund.

Often overlooked, however, are the high levels of speciation and diversification in the area. Here we assess the phylogenetic relationships within a Mesoamerican group of hummingbirds (Lampornis). We sequenced both mtDNA (1,143 bp of cyt b and 727 bp of ND5) and nuclear genes (505 bp of AK-5 intron and 567 bp of c-mos) for each of the seven recognised species and outgroups. We find two or three clades of similar age within this genus: L. clemenciae and L. amethystinus (singly or as each other's sister taxa) and a Central American clade. This Central-American clade presents a clear bipartition between northern (L. viridipallens and L. sybillae) and southern Mesoamerica, which is shared with many other Mesoamerican organisms. Our analyses suggest that L. hemileucus does not belong in the genus Lampornis. While we refrain to apply a time-scale to our data because of the lack of an appropriate calibration, our results indicate that the genus Lampornis predates the uprising of the Panama land-bridge, and that diversification among the isthmian species (L. castaneoventris and L. calolaema) is a very recent event. Our results strongly suggest a local Mesoamerican origin for this genus.","AcknowledgmentsTissue samples were provided by the F. Sheldon (LSU Museum of Natural History), M.J.

To date, coral growth parameters have been poorly reported in Pocillopora species in the northeastern region of the tropical Pacific. Monthly and annual growth rates of the three most abundant morphospecies (P. cf. verrucosa, P. cf. capitata, and P. cf. damicornis) were evaluated during two annual periods at a site on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The first annual period, 2010-2011 was considered a strong ENSO/La Niña period with cool sea surface temperatures, then followed by a non-ENSO period in 2012-2013. The linear extension rate, skeletal density, and calcification rate averaged (±SD) were 2.31 ± 0.11 cm yr-1, 1.65 ± 0.18 g cm-3, 5.03 ± 0.84 g cm-2 yr-1 respectively, during the strong ENSO event. In contrast, the respective non-ENSO values were 3.50 ± 0.64 cm yr-1, 1.70 ± 0.18 g cm-3, and 6.02 ± 1.36 g cm-2 yr-1. This corresponds to 52% and 20% faster linear extension and calcification rates, respectively, during non-ENSO period. The evidence suggests that Pocillopora branching species responded positively with faster growth rates following thermal anomalies, which allow them to maintain coral communities in the region.","JJATL’s work was supported by the doctoral fellowship by CONACYT (National Council of Science and Technology) No. 262538.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of kdr mutations in a partial region of the VGSC gene in samples of wild-caught Aedes mosquitoes from different locations of the Metropolitan Region of Panama.ResultsBased on the analysis of 194 sequences of the VGSC gene, two kdr mutations (Ile1011Met and Val1016Gly) were detected in a specimen of Ae. aegypti. The frequency of kdr mutations in the evaluated samples of Ae. aegypti was 0.01.ConclusionsThis study provides evidence for a low frequency of kdr mutations in Ae. aegypti populations in Panama. It is possible that these changes have no impact on vector control interventions. To our knowledge, we report, for the first time in America the Val1016Gly mutation documented in Asia. In general terms, this result is highly relevant to the Aedes Control Programme in Panama since it constitutes a feasible approach for the timely detection of resistance as well as for the development of strategies.","We thank the staff of the Department of Research in Medical Entomology (Departamento de Investigación en Entomología Médica, DIEM) of the Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies (Instituto Conmemorativo Gorgas de Estudios de la Salud, ICGES).

Fungi have for a long time been, and unfortunately still are, underestimated when it comes to taxonomic research. The foundations were laid by the first mycologists through field observations. These important fundamental works have been and remain vital reference works. Nevertheless, a non-negligible part of the studied funga escaped their attention. Thanks to modern developments in molecular techniques, the study of fungal diversity has been revolutionized in terms of tools and knowledge. Despite a number of disadvantages inherent to these techniques, traditional field-based inventory work has been increasingly superseded and neglected. This perspective aims to demonstrate the central importance of field-based research in fungal diversity studies, and encourages researchers not to be blinded by the sole use of molecular methods.",Claus Bässler (Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main) is thanked for critical help with references.

The Chucantí Nature Reserve, in Serranía de Majé, consists of a diverse tropical cloud forest ecosystem. The aim of this research was to explore and study host associations of a tripartite system of bats, ectoparasitic flies on bats (Diptera, Streblidae), and ectoparasitic fungi (Ascomycota, Laboulbeniales) that use bat flies as hosts. We captured bats at Chucantí, screened each bat for presence of bat flies, and screened collected bat flies for presence of Laboulbeniales. We mistnetted for 68 mistnet hours and captured 227 bats representing 17 species. We captured Micronycteris schmidtorum, a species previously unreported in Darién. In addition, we encountered the rarely collected Platyrrhinus dorsalis, representing the westernmost report for this species. Of all captured bats, 148 carried bat flies (65%). The number of sampled bat flies was 437, representing 16 species. One species represents a new country record (Trichobius anducei) and five species represent first reports for Darién (Basilia anceps, Anatrichobius scorzai, Nycterophilia parnelli, T. johnsonae, T. parasiticus). All 74 bat fly species currently reported in Panama are presented in tabulated form. Of all screened bat flies, 30 bore Laboulbeniales fungi (7%). Based on both morphology and large ribosomal subunit (LSU) sequence data, we delimited 7 species of Laboulbeniales: Gloeandromyces nycteribiidarum (newly reported for Panama), G. pageanus, G. streblae, Nycteromyces streblidinus, and 3 undescribed species. Of the 30 infected flies, 21 were Trichobius joblingi. This species was the only host on which we observed double infections of Laboulbeniales.","We would like to thank Guido Berguido (Asociación Adopta el Bosque Panamá), Michelle Nowak, and Rachel Page (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Gamboa, Panama) for helping with logistical aspects of this expedition to Chucantí; W.

These organisms have a temperature range where their physiological processes are more efficient, this range is usually a requirement set phylogenetically even though they vary in the use of habitats. This research compares the thermal ecophysiology of Basiliscus galeritus (western basilisk) in two populations with altitudinal differences in the northwestern of Ecuador. The results suggest that the difference of altitude between the two locations (500 m) influences the thermal ecophysiology of the species since the body temperature (Tb), operative temperature (Te) and preferred body temperature (Tset) showed significative differences. Furthermore, B. galeritus obtains its Tb through heliothermy and it behaves as an active thermoregulator. On the other hand, the crest temperatures reach higher values than their Tset, the results suggested that the species uses the crest as an alternative to regulate its body temperature when exceeding its Tset. Besides, this thermoregulatory behavior has been suggested only in some extinct synapsids.","The authors thank Diana Camacho, Jonathan Mora and Karen Cifuentes for all help in the field and the facilities provided during the samplings.

In hyper-diverse environments like tropical rain forests, coexistence of epiphytic orchids may be facilitated through mycorrhizal fungal specialization (i.e., sets of unique and dominant mycorrhizal fungi associated with a particular host species). However, information on the role of orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) in niche differentiation and coexistence of epiphytic orchids is still scarce. In this study, we sought to identify the variation in fungal preferences of four co-occurring epiphytic orchids in a tropical rainforest in Costa Rica by addressing the identity and composition of their endophytic fungal and OMF communities across species and life stages. We show that the endophytic fungal communities are formed mainly of previously recognized OMF taxa, and that the four coexisting orchid species have both a set of shared mycorrhizal fungi and a group of fungi unique to an orchid species. We also found that adult plants keep the OMF of the juvenile stage while adding new mycobionts over time. This study provides evidence for the utilization of specific OMF that may be involved in niche segregation, and for an aggregation mechanism where adult orchids keep initial fungal mycobionts of the juvenile stage while adding others.","We thank the Ministerio de Ambiente y Energía (MINAE) and Sistema Nacional de Áreas de Conservación (SINAC) of Costa Rica for issuing scientific permits under which orchid specimens were collected.

This compound showed an inhibitory effect over the myotoxic activity of Bothrops jararacussu and Bothrops asper venoms, being also effective against the indirect hemolytic activity of B. asper venom. Besides, AA also inhibited the myotoxic activity of BthTX-I and MTX-II with an efficiency greater than 60% against both myotoxins. Docking predictions revealed an interesting mechanism, through which the AA displays an interaction profile consistent with its inhibiting abilities, binding to both active and putative sites of svPLA2. Overall, the present findings indicate that AA may bind to critical regions of myotoxic Asp 49 and Lys49-PLA2s from snake venoms, highlighting the relevance of domains comprising the active and putative sites to inhibit these toxins.","The authors express their gratitude to Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP), Fundação Rondônia de Amparo ao Desenvolvimento das Ações Científicas e Tecnológicas de Pesquisa do Estado de Rondônia (FAPERO), Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), and Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología y Innovación (SENACYT) de Panamá for the financial support.

Traditional taxonomic arrangements have separated populations of this genus into three species, based on plumage variation, although plumage patterns are well known to exhibit homoplasy. We present a first detailed phylogeographic and phylogenetic study, focused on Mesoamerican populations, and signal the existence of strong differentiation among populations with a clear geographic structure. We find well differentiated clades for (1) the Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre del Sur in Oaxaca, (2) western Mexican populations, including the B. brunneinucha populations in the Sierra Madre del Sur and B. virenticeps, (3) Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra de los Tuxtlas, (4) northern Central America, (5) southern Central America, (6) middle Central America, and (7) South America.

Here, we evaluate the influence of the Neogene and Quaternary geological events, as well as the climatic changes in the diversification of the colubrid snake genus Rhadinaea using molecular dating and ancestral area reconstruction. A multilocus sequence dataset was generated for 37 individuals of Rhadinaea from most of the biogeographical provinces where the genus is distributed, representing 19 of the 21 currently recognized species, and two undescribed species. Our analyses show that the majority of the Rhadinaea species nest in two main clades, herein identified as ""Eastern"" and ""Southern"". These clades probably diverged from each other in the early Miocene, and their divergence was followed by 11 divergences during the middle to late Miocene, three divergences during the Pliocene, and six divergences in the Pleistocene. The ancestral distribution of Rhadinaea was reconstructed across the Sierra Madre del Sur. Our phylogenetic analyses do not support the monophyly of Rhadinaea. The Miocene and Pliocene geomorphology, perhaps in conjunction with climate change, appears to have triggered the diversification of the genus, while the climatic changes during the Miocene probably induced the diversification of Rhadinaea in the Sierra Madre del Sur. Our analysis suggests that the uplifting of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Chiapan-Guatemalan highlands in this same period resulted in northward and southward colonization events. This was followed by more recent, independent colonization events in the Pliocene and Pleistocene involving the Balsas Basin, Chihuahuan Desert, Pacific Coast, Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra Madre del Sur, Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, and Veracruz provinces, probably driven by the climatic fluctuations of the time.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Support for fieldwork was provided by grants from DGAPA, UNAM (PAPIIT no.

We have recently found that the pleioclonal-->monoclonal transition may occur early during the PL latency and long before the eruption of a full blown lymphoma. We sought to find out what causes one PL clone to become dominant. Our working hypothesis was that a dominant clone(s) at the PL stage has the ability to inhibit the development of other, recessive clones. Since some premalignant characteristics of a progenitor clone are probably maintained in the descending lymphoma, we studied whether tumors that developed after injection of a high dose (HD) of PL cells were dominant over tumors that developed after injection of a limiting dose (LD) of PL cells. To identify dominant clones, HD and LD lymphomas were mixed in a co-culture and the outgrowth of one clone over the other was determined by T beta-TCR rearrangement analysis. A checker-board combination of seven lymphomas revealed a dominance hierarchy scale. Lymphomas induced directly by the virus (without transfer) were dominant over both HD and LD lymphomas. High dose lymphomas were dominant over LD lymphomas and LD lymphomas were always recessive. The speed at which a dominant lymphoma outgrew the co-culture suggested that dominance is acquired through the ability of the prevailing cells to actively suppress the growth of recessive cells.",,,Leukemia Research,,,"Animals; Coculture Techniques; Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor; Lymphoma; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Preleukemia; Radiation Leukemia Virus; Retroviridae Infections; Tumor Virus Infections",1995-12,1995,,1995-12,19,12,971-976,Closed,Article,"Avni, O.; Yefenof, E.; Kotler, M.","Avni, O.

Measures to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused widespread changes in human activity, leading to a months-long reduction in seismic noise of up to 50%. The 2020 seismic noise quiet period is the longest and most prominent global anthropogenic seismic noise reduction on record. Although the reduction is strongest at surface seismometers in populated areas, this seismic quiescence extends for many kilometers radially and hundreds of meters in depth. This quiet period provides an opportunity to detect subtle signals from subsurface seismic sources that would have been concealed in noisier times and to benchmark sources of anthropogenic noise. A strong correlation between seismic noise and independent measurements of human mobility suggests that seismology provides an absolute, real-time estimate of human activities.","We sincerely thank two anonymous reviewers, T.

Interactions between fungi and other organisms, specifically invertebrates, are understudied. Their numbers are also severely underestimated. Invertebrates exist in many of the same spaces as fungi and are known to engage in fungal feeding or mycophagy. This review aims to provide a comprehensive, global view of mycophagy in invertebrates to bring attention to areas that need more research, by prospecting the existing literature. Separate searches on the Web of Science were performed using the terms ""mycophagy"" and ""fungivore"". Invertebrate species and corresponding fungal species were extracted from the articles retrieved, whether the research was field- or laboratory-based, and the location of the observation if field-based. Articles were excluded if they did not list at least a genus identification for both the fungi and invertebrates. The search yielded 209 papers covering seven fungal phyla and 19 invertebrate orders. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are the most represented fungal phyla whereas Coleoptera and Diptera make up most of the invertebrate observations. Most field-based observations originated from North America and Europe. Research on invertebrate mycophagy is lacking in some important fungal phyla, invertebrate orders, and geographic regions.","This manuscript was developed during the Writing Academic Papers course offered at Ghent University (course code X000947, 2021–2022) and received input from Mhd Baraa Almoujahed, Karaneh Eftekhari, Stijn Kindt, Qiuzhen Ren, and Nathan Schoutteten.

We conducted a globally distributed experiment (38 streams across 23 countries in 6 continents) using standardised methods to test the hypothesis that detritivore diversity enhances litter decomposition in streams, to establish the role of other characteristics of detritivore assemblages (abundance, biomass and body size), and to determine how patterns vary across realms, biomes and climates. We observed a positive relationship between diversity and decomposition, strongest in tropical areas, and a key role of abundance and biomass at higher latitudes. Our results suggest that litter decomposition might be altered by detritivore extinctions, particularly in tropical areas, where detritivore diversity is already relatively low and some environmental stressors particularly prevalent.","We thank the many students and technicians who helped with research in different regions (S.

3066,pub.1107660844,10.1111/plb.12925,30326544,,Species distribution modelling and cpSSR reveal population history of the Neotropical annual herb Tithonia rotundifolia (Asteraceae),"The impacts of the historical geologic and climatic events on the diversity and genetic structure of Neotropical taxa have recently become a subject of study. However, annual plants associated with tropical dry forests remain under-studied. The exploration of additional taxa in contrasting environments will improve the current understanding of responses of the Neotropical biota to these events. Here, we explore the species distribution and geographic structure of the annual herb Tithonia rotundifolia. We sampled 175 individuals from 19 populations of T. rotundifolia. Species distribution modelling and six microsatellite chloroplast loci were used to infer its population history. We identified areas of historical climate suitability and then tested if there is genetic structuring among these areas. Haplotypes showed strong phylogeographic structure. Historical climatic suitability areas were found along the Pacific coast; however, a gap was found at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (IT). Although Bayesian analysis showed population structuring, amova revealed that the IT is not its main driver. Instead, a subdivision into a higher number of regions had higher FCT values. Also, populations to the east of the IT showed evidence of recent population expansion and migration in a south-north direction. Pleistocene climate fluctuations partially explain the geographic structure of T. rotundifolia. However, life-history characteristics such as limited seed dispersal and the patchy distribution of suitable habitats explain the high haplotype diversity and population sub-structuring and diversity. Lastly, the absence of geographic structure of some haplotypes may indicate long-distance dispersal, or hybridisation with the closely related T. tubaeformis.","This research was supported by a CONACyT scholarship grant to A.L.C.

These are: Gloeandromyces dickii sp. nov. on Trichobius joblingi from Nicaragua and Panama; G. pageanus f. alarum f. nov. on Tri. joblingi from Panama; G. pageanus f. polymorphus f. nov. on Tri. dugesioides and Tri. joblingi from Panama and Trinidad; and G. streblae f. sigmomorphus f. nov. on Tri. joblingi from Panama. Gloeandromyces pageanus on Tri. dugesioides from Panama as described in Nova Hedwigia 105 (2017) is referred to as G. pageanus f. pageanus. Support for these descriptions of species and formae comes from phylogenetic reconstruction of the large subunit ribosomal DNA and from the application of species delimitation methods (ABGD, bPTP, GMYC). Host specialization results in phylogenetic segregation by host species in both G. pageanus and G. streblae and this may represent a case of incipient speciation. A second mechanism driving diversity involves position-induced morphological adaptations, leading to the peculiar morphotypes that are associated to growing on a particular position of the integument (G. pageanus f. alarum, G. streblae f. sigmomorphus).","Unknowingly, Jasmin Camacho (Harvard University) presented the first author with a silly little bat fly back in 2014.

To fill this knowledge gap, we have carried out an extensive analysis of Bermudan Syllidae, combining morphological and molecular data including four nuclear and mitochondrial markers (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA and 28S rRNA). We have identified and established the phylogenetic position of five new species, Haplosyllis anitae n. sp., Haplosyllis guillei n. sp., Haplosyllis larsi n. sp., Haplosyllis vassiae n. sp. and Syllis laiae n. sp., together with Haplosyllis cf. cephalata. Overall, our results extend the knowledge on the diversity of Syllidae in Bermuda, increasing the number of species present in the area to 25. Our results also recover Opisthosyllis and Syllis as non-monophyletic genera, for which traditional diagnostic morphological features do not accurately reflect their evolutionary histories, and thus we propose that these groups should be reorganized based on molecular characters.","We wish to express our gratitude to all the colleagues and friends who assisted us during our stay at BIOS specially Leocadio Blanco-Bercial, Gretchen Goodbody-Gringley, Luis Portillo and Kelly Creighton.

The Eucalyptusglobulus enzyme was characterized in vitro, and results showed that the preferred substrates were coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol. Complementation experiments demonstrated that both cDNA and genomic constructs derived from F5H from E. globulus under the control of the cinnamate 4-hydroxylase promoter from Arabidopsis thaliana, or a partial F5H promoter from E. globulus, can rescue the inability of the A. thalianafah1-2 mutant to accumulate sinapate esters and syringyl lignin. E. globulus is a species widely used to obtain products that require lignin removal, and the results suggest that EglF5H is a good candidate for engineering efforts aimed at increasing the lignin syringyl unit content, either for kraft pulping or biofuel production.",,,Plant Cell Reports,,,"Acrolein; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Eucalyptus; Gene Expression; Kinetics; Lignin; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Phenotype; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Substrate Specificity",2014-04-16,2014,2014-04-16,2014-08,33,8,1263-1274,Closed,Article,"García, José Renán; Anderson, Nickolas; Le-Feuvre, Regis; Iturra, Carolina; Elissetche, Juan; Chapple, Clint; Valenzuela, Sofía","García, José Renán (Centro de Biotecnología y Facultad Ciencias Forestales, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile; Centro de Investigación en Bioquímica y Química Aplicada, Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí, David, Panamá); Anderson, Nickolas (Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, 47907, West Lafayette, IN, USA); Le-Feuvre, Regis (Genómica Forestal, Concepción, Chile); Iturra, Carolina (Genómica Forestal, Concepción, Chile); Elissetche, Juan (Genómica Forestal, Concepción, Chile); Chapple, Clint (Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, 47907, West Lafayette, IN, USA); Valenzuela, Sofía (Centro de Biotecnología y Facultad Ciencias Forestales, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile)","Valenzuela, Sofía (University of Concepción)","García, José Renán (University of Concepción; Autonomous University of Chiriqui); Anderson, Nickolas (Purdue University West Lafayette); Le-Feuvre, Regis (Genómica Forestal, Concepción, Chile); Iturra, Carolina (Genómica Forestal, Concepción, Chile); Elissetche, Juan (Genómica Forestal, Concepción, Chile); Chapple, Clint (Purdue University West Lafayette); Valenzuela, Sofía (University of Concepción)",19,2,0.56,1.49,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017134968,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology,

Diversity of this litter may influence instream decomposition globally in ways that are not yet understood. We investigated latitudinal differences in decomposition of litter mixtures of low and high functional diversity in 40 streams on 6 continents and spanning 113° of latitude. Despite important variability in our dataset, we found latitudinal differences in the effect of litter functional diversity on decomposition, which we explained as evolutionary adaptations of litter-consuming detritivores to resource availability. Specifically, a balanced diet effect appears to operate at lower latitudes versus a resource concentration effect at higher latitudes. The latitudinal pattern indicates that loss of plant functional diversity will have different consequences on carbon fluxes across the globe, with greater repercussions likely at low latitudes.","We thank the many researchers, students, and technicians who helped with research in different regions (S.

Accepted methods for surveying and locating sunken oil are generally slow, labor intensive and spatially imprecise. This paper describes a method to locate seafloor contamination caused by heavy oil fractions using in situ mass spectrometry and concurrent acoustic navigation. We present results of laboratory sensitivity tests and proof-of-concept evaluations conducted at the US Coast Guard OHMSETT national oil spill response test facility. Preliminary results from a robotic seafloor contamination survey conducted in deep water using the mass spectrometer and a geo-referenced acoustic navigation system are also described. Results indicate that this technological approach can accurately localize seafloor oil contamination in real-time at spatial resolutions better than a decimeter.","AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to acknowledge the US Dept. of Homeland Security’s US Coast Guard Research and Development Center for research support through Contract No. HSCG32-07-C-R00027; the National Ocean Partnership Program for research grant support in the development of the TETHYS mass spectrometer (No. OCE-0537173); researchers and technicians at the OHMSETT test facility; and the US Coast Guard Research and Development Center for their help, particularly Kurt Hansen and Penny Herring for their assistance during testing at the OHMSETT facility.

This is evident in species-rich lineages, where the ancestral and derived states and their gains and losses are difficult to assess. Phylogenetic comparative methods help to evaluate the convergent evolution of a given morphological character, thus enabling the discovery of traits useful for classifications. In this study, we investigate the evolution of selected traits to test for their suitability for generic delimitations in the clade Lepanthes, one of the Neotropical species-richest groups. We evaluated every generic name proposed in the Lepanthes clade producing densely sampled phylogenies with Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian approaches. Using Ancestral State Reconstructions, we then assessed 18 phenotypic characters that have been traditionally employed to diagnose genera. We propose the recognition of 14 genera based on solid morphological delimitations. Among the characters assessed, we identified 16 plesiomorphies, 12 homoplastic characters, and seven synapomorphies, the latter of which are reproductive features mostly related to the pollination by pseudocopulation and possibly correlated with rapid diversifications in Lepanthes. Furthermore, the ancestral states of some reproductive characters suggest that these traits are associated with pollination mechanisms alike promoting homoplasy. Our methodological approach enables the discovery of useful traits for generic delimitations in the Lepanthes clade and offers various other testable hypotheses on trait evolution for future research on Pleurothallidinae orchids because the phenotypic variation of some characters evaluated here also occurs in other diverse genera.","The authors thank the Ministerio de Ambiente y Energía (MINAE) and Sistema Nacional de Áreas de Conservación (SINAC) of Costa Rica for issuing the scientific permits 026–2011-SINAC, 073-2012-SINAC, R-SINAC-DE-077, and SINAC-SE-GASP-PI-R-019-2015 for collecting wild plant material.

It is argued that SSB taxes are relatively easy to implement from a practical perspective compared to for example other nutrition policies. However, the implementation of SSB taxation laws does not happen by itself. Therefore, this work examines implementation processes for SSB taxation in terms of (1) pre-implementation context, (2) taxation instruments used and (3) interactions in the implementation process. Ten databases and grey literature were systematically searched for studies reporting on SSB taxation implementation processes up to February 2020. All studies (N = 1248) were screened independently by two reviewers according to predefined criteria. The selection of variables to be extracted was based on the policy cycle heuristic and informed by intervention implementation research. Information on the process of implementing  SSB taxation is limited. Only six cases based on three publications were identified, indicating a gap in this research area. SSB taxation implementation was accomplished by hiring a subcontractor for the implementation or using pre-existing tax collection structures. Political and public support within the implementation process seems to be supportive for the city of Berkeley and for Portugal but was not reported for the Pacific Islands. However, the existing data are very limited, and further research on SSB taxation implementation processes is needed to determine whether the aim of the policy and the envisaged outcome are linked in practice.

Recent DNA based phylogenies show that unusual flower morphology of 'eugenioid' collections, e.g. fused calices that open by tearing, consistently emerged within Eugenia. These results emphasize a demand to revaluate flower morphology in a phylogenetic context within the genus. A reassessment of calyx fusion in Eugenia and traditionally related genera is here focused on clarification of the systematic relevance of this apparently recurrent characteristic. Twenty-four Eugenia species with some level of calyx fusion in the bud were newly used (one nuclear and four plastid markers) in conjunction with a representative sample of previously sequenced species to recover a time-calibrated Eugenia phylogeny of 86 accessions. Development of the fused calyx was analysed using scanning electron microscopy, differing patterns were re-coded and subsequently phylogenetic character reconstruction was performed. Eugenia was recovered as monophyletic including the traditionally segregated genera Calycorectes and Catinga. Ancestral character reconstruction uncovered free calyx lobes as the ancestral condition. Five development patterns leading to calyx fusion are reported in Eugenia including species with apparently six petals, which contrast with the standard tetramerous flowers. This condition is interpreted as the petaloid pattern, where two external fused calyx lobes cover the bud while two internal calyx lobes are free and petaloid. The fused calyx condition is homoplastic and evolved independently, several times in Eugenia, as did the different development patterns. Data presented here show that systematic incongruence resulting from multiple, independent origins of the fused calyx in Eugenia is further aggravated by an inability to distinguish parallelism and convergence within the recovered patterns.","This study was supported by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) and São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP process no 2014/04043-9 and no 2016/04678-0), and the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT).

These species included primarily Nearctic migratory species such as the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and neotropical migratory species such as the blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata), alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus), northern waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis), and bank swallow (Riparia riparia) as well as one long-distance palearctic migrant, the arctic warbler (Phylloscopus borealis). The more prevalent parasites were Leucocytozoon dubreuili (73% of the sampled turdinids), L. fringillinarum (42% of the sampled fringillids and parulids), and Trypanosoma avium (39% of the sampled hosts). Other parasites (H. fallisi: 18% of the sampled turdinids; Haemoproteus paruli: 14% of the sampled parulids; H. fringillae: 5% of the sampled fringillids; microfilariae: 4% of the sampled hosts) were observed less frequently. Plasmodium vaughani was found only in two yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia). Overall parasite prevalence varied between 0% in the alder flycatcher to >80% in Swainson's thrush, arctic warbler, and Townsend's warbler (Dendroica townsendi). Prevalence of various hematozoa also was bird species-dependent. No relationship was observed between prevalence and either foraging (aerial versus trees/shrubs) or nesting habits (ground versus arboreal) or general location of the wintering area of the different species examined. Prevalence also was unrelated to average dates of arrival on breeding grounds and, therefore, to potential duration of exposure to local insect vectors before capture. Differences in blood parasite prevalence among species breeding in a same region and in the same type of habitat may result from differences in host specificity such as immunological resistance to infection or blood meal preference by potential vectors and/or in behavioral adjustments/physiological traits that alter exposure to vectors.",,,Journal of Wildlife Diseases,,,Alaska; Animals; Bird Diseases; Environment; Eukaryota; Female; Haemosporida; Male; Parasitemia; Prevalence; Reproduction; Seasons; Songbirds; Trypanosoma,2001-01,2001,,2001-01,37,1,28-35,All OA; Green,Article,"Deviche, Pierre; Greiner, Ellis C.; Manteca, Xavier","Deviche, Pierre (Department of Biology, Arizona State University, P.O.

Field work was carried out in Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador and Peru, including exploration in areas where the genus had not been collected before. These specimens and observations were complemented with the study of specimens of 41 herbaria of North, Central and South America, as well as Europe. Detailed morphological studies of all species were carried out, based on living plants in their natural habitat, as well as on dried specimens from our own collections and all available herbarium material. Type material was studied in detail for all species concerned. Based on an extensive number of morphological characters, combined with distribution patterns, phenological differences and ecological preferences, including molecular data in most cases, Hydrangea peruviana and H. oerstedii are clearly distinct taxa, as well as the other seven species mentioned here, which had been synonymized with either of these two species. The present study results in the recognition of 26 species in section Cornidia and exemplifies the urgent need for profound taxonomic studies in plants, as in many families we do not dispose of well-circumscribed units for conservation to mitigate the already occurring unprecedented loss of biodiversity.","Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds of the Ghent University, Belgium, the Research Foundation Flanders, the Systematics Association and private funds of the first author and of Rita Carron, Gent, Belgium We are grateful to the authorities of Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama and Peru for issuing the collection permits 020-2012-SINAC, 041-2012-SINAC, 001-12-IC-FLO-DNB/MA, SE/P-11-19, 0124-2011-AG-DGFFS-DGEFFS and 0395-2013-MINAGRI-DGFFS/DGEFFS, respectively.

Species composition and assemblage structure of gorgonians (Anthozoa: Octocorallia) were studied along a bathymetric profile in the Southern Mexican Pacific coast. Species composition was based on specimens collected within a depth range of 0-70 m in 15 sites. The relative abundance of species was determined in six sites at four depths (5, 10, 20 and 25 m) using three 10 m2 transects at each depth level. Twenty-seven species of gorgonians belonging to six genera and three families were registered. The species composition varied with depth: 11 species were distributed between 0-25m depth, while 17 species were found between 40-70 m depth interval. The shallow zone is characterized by a relatively large abundance of gorgonians, dominated by colonies of Leptogorgia cuspidata and L. ena. In contrast, the deepest zone was characterized by relatively low abundance of gorgonians, dominated by L. alba, the only species observed in both depth intervals. The similarity analysis showed differences in the composition and abundance of species by depth and site, suggesting that the main factor in determining the assemblage structure is depth. Results of this study suggest that the highest richness of gorgonian species in the study area may be located at depths of 40-70 m, whereas the highest abundances are found between 5 and 10 m depth.

Phylogeographic studies in this region are few in comparison with other regions and even less for tree species. The aim of the present study was to characterize the phylogeographic structure in 2 partially co-distributed endemic oak species (Quercus costaricensis and Q. bumelioides) of the Costa Rican mountains using chloroplast short sequence repeats (cpSSRs), and to test for the effect of geological and palaeoclimatic processes on their population history. Genetic diversity and structure, haplotype networks, patterns of seed-mediated gene flow and historical demography were estimated for both species. Results suggested contrasting patterns. Quercus costaricensis exhibited high values of genetic diversity, a marked phylogeographic structure, a north-to-south genetic diversity gradient and evidence of a demographic expansion during the Quaternary. Quercus bumelioides did not show significant genetic structure and the haplotype network and historical demography estimates suggested a recent population expansion probably during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. The phylogeographic structure of Q. costaricensis seems to be related to Pleistocene altitudinal migration due to its higher altitudinal distribution. Meanwhile, historical seed-mediated gene flow through the lower altitudinal distribution of Q. bumelioides may have promoted the homogenization of genetic variation. Population expansion and stable availability of suitable climatic areas in both species probably indicate that palaeoclimatic changes promoted downwards altitudinal migration and formation of continuous forests allowing oak species to expand their distribution into the Panamanian mountains during glacial stages.","The authors thank Jorge Lobo for laboratory access at the Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR), Alfredo Cascante, Silvana Martén and Jorge Lobo for support during the field and laboratory stages in Costa Rica, the Escuela Nacional de Estudios Superiores Unidad Morelia and the Laboratorio Nacional de Análisis y Síntesis Ecológica para la Conservación de los Recursos Genéticos (LANASE) for providing facilities to develop this study at UNAM.",This work was supported by the Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigación e Innovación Tecnológica of the Dirección General Asuntos del Personal Académico at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (funder ID 501100006087) (grant numbers IV201015 and IA208017); the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología de México (ID 501100007350) (grant number 240136); the Red Latinoamericana de Botánica-Andrew W.

Triatoma dimidiata, the main vector throughout Central America and up to Ecuador, presents extensive phenotypic, genotypic, and behavioral diversity in sylvatic, peridomestic and domestic habitats, and non-domiciliated populations acting as reinfestation sources. DNA sequence analyses, phylogenetic reconstruction methods, and genetic variation approaches are combined to investigate the haplotype profiling, genetic polymorphism, phylogeography, and evolutionary trends of T. dimidiata and its closest relatives within Triatoma. This is the largest interpopulational analysis performed on a triatomine species so far.
METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: Triatomines from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Cuba, Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil were used. Triatoma dimidiata populations follow different evolutionary divergences in which geographical isolation appears to have had an important influence. A southern Mexican-northern Guatemalan ancestral form gave rise to two main clades. One clade remained confined to the Yucatan peninsula and northern parts of Chiapas State, Guatemala, and Honduras, with extant descendants deserving specific status. Within the second clade, extant subspecies diversity was shaped by adaptive radiation derived from Guatemalan ancestral populations. Central American populations correspond to subspecies T. d. dimidiata. A southern spread into Panama and Colombia gave the T. d. capitata forms, and a northwestern spread rising from Guatemala into Mexico gave the T. d. maculipennis forms. Triatoma hegneri appears as a subspecific insular form.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparison with very numerous Triatoma species allows us to reach highly supported conclusions not only about T. dimidiata, but also on different, important Triatoma species groupings and their evolution. The very large intraspecific genetic variability found in T. dimidiata sensu lato has never been detected in a triatomine species before. The distinction between the five different taxa furnishes a new frame for future analyses of the different vector transmission capacities and epidemiological characteristics of Chagas disease. Results indicate that T. dimidiata will offer problems for control, although dwelling insecticide spraying might be successful against introduced populations in Ecuador.","D.R.

Recent phylogenetic studies have cast doubt on the monophyly of the genus and highlighted the need for a phylogenetic study focused on Conostegia. The purpose of this study was to test the monophyly of Conostegia and address relationships in the genus. We addressed the evolutionary history of Conostegia using DNA sequences from six loci. Difficulty in finding discrete characters that support clades prompted an anatomical survey of leaves and flowers as well as the exploratory use of some continuous characters. We coded as many species as possible for fifteen characters. Lastly, field work was conducted to document floral traits at anthesis due to the poor quality of preservation of flowers on herbarium specimens. Conostegia was found to be paraphyletic and composed of three main clades. The historically important characters of a calyptrate calyx and pleiostemony were found to have evolved more than once inside the Conostegia clade. Several other characters were found to support the clades we identified. The most unusual characters were mucilage inside the ovary which is here reported in the Melastomataceae for the first time, a stele inside the style which is mostly restricted to one clade of Conostegia and known only in this clade of the Melastomataceae, and herkogamy which has been lost in two clades within Conostegia. A combination of molecular phylogenetic analyses and broad morphological surveys allowed the better understanding of the evolutionary history in a clade of mostly cloud forest Neotropical trees. The need to include anatomical studies and tackle continuous characters is here demonstrated.","We would like to thank the following people for providing us with samples for DNA extraction, photographs of live plants in the field, or liquid-preserved material: Walter S.

Also, the regionalization of antivenoms may be important for some countries with special scorpionism characteristics.
OBJECTIVE: Production of antibodies capable of neutralizing the lethal effect of the venom of three scorpion species from Panama.
METHODS: The primary structures of two neurotoxins from T. pachyurus, one from T. cerroazul and another from C. bicolor were elucidated using N-terminal amino acid degradation and Sanger gene cloned sequencing. The obtained mRNA transcripts were cloned and expressed using E. coli vectors. Different bacterial expression conditions were tested and the best culture conditions for each expressed protein is reported. The expressed scorpion toxins were purified by chromatographic methods and used as immunogens in rabbits.
RESULTS: The antibodies produced under the reported immunization scheme show better neutralization (ED50) than other reported commercial antivenoms used to neutralize similar species scorpion venoms under similar LD50 conditions.
CONCLUSION: The information reported here shows the proof of concept for selecting recombinant immunogens with the ability to produce antibodies for neutralizing the lethal effects of the most important medical species of scorpions in Panama.","The authors acknowledge to M.

This phase 1/2, observer-blind, randomized, controlled study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational chimpanzee-derived adenoviral vector RSV vaccine (ChAd155-RSV, expressing RSV F, N, and M2-1) in infants.
METHODS: Healthy 6- to 7-month-olds were 1:1:1-randomized to receive 1 low ChAd155-RSV dose (1.5 × 1010 viral particles) followed by placebo (RSV_1D); 2 high ChAd155-RSV doses (5 × 1010 viral particles) (RSV_2D); or active comparator vaccines/placebo (comparator) on days 1 and 31. Follow-up lasted approximately 2 years.
RESULTS: Two hundred one infants were vaccinated (RSV_1D: 65; RSV_2D: 71; comparator: 65); 159 were RSV-seronaive at baseline. Most solicited and unsolicited adverse events after ChAd155-RSV occurred at similar or lower rates than after active comparators. In infants who developed RSV infection, there was no evidence of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD). RSV-A neutralizing titers and RSV F-binding antibody concentrations were higher post-ChAd155-RSV than postcomparator at days 31, 61, and end of RSV season 1 (mean follow-up, 7 months). High-dose ChAd155-RSV induced stronger responses than low-dose, with further increases post-dose 2.
CONCLUSIONS: ChAd155-RSV administered to 6- to 7-month-olds had a reactogenicity/safety profile like other childhood vaccines, showed no evidence of VAERD, and induced a humoral immune response.

Here we describe the spatial structure of a benthic anomuran red crab population, using submarine video and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) photographs. High density aggregations and a swarm of red crabs were associated with a dense turbid layer 4-10 m above the bottom. The high density aggregations were constrained to 355-385 m water depth over the Northwest flank of the seamount, although the crabs also occurred at lower densities in shallower waters (∼280 m) and in another location of the seamount. The crab aggregations occurred in hypoxic water, with oxygen levels of 0.04 ml/l. Barcoding of Hannibal red crabs, and pelagic red crabs sampled in a mass stranding event in 2015 at a beach in San Diego, California, USA, revealed that the Panamanian and the Californian crabs are likely the same species, Pleuroncodes planipes, and these findings represent an extension of the southern endrange of this species. Measurements along a 1.6 km transect revealed three high density aggregations, with the highest density up to 78 crabs/m(2), and that the crabs were patchily distributed. Crab density peaked in the middle of the patch, a density structure similar to that of swarming insects.","This work was sponsored by a grant from the Dalio Foundation, Inc, through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

Case numbers quickly decreased afterward, and Panama is now in the pre-elimination stage of malaria eradication. To achieve this new goal, the characterization of epidemiological risk factors, foci of transmission, and important anopheline vectors is needed. Of the 24,681 reported cases in these analyses (2000-2014), ~62% occurred in epidemic years and ~44% in indigenous comarcas (5.9% of Panama's population). Sub-analyses comparing overall numbers of cases in epidemic and non-epidemic years identified females, comarcas and some 5-year age categories as those disproportionately affected by malaria during epidemic years. Annual parasites indices (APIs; number of cases per 1,000 persons) for Plasmodium vivax were higher in comarcas compared to provinces for all study years, though P. falciparum APIs were only higher in comarcas during epidemic years. Interestingly, two comarcas report increasing numbers of cases annually, despite national annual decreases. Inclusion of these comarcas within identified foci of malaria transmission confirmed their roles in continued transmission. Comparison of species distribution models for two important anophelines with Plasmodium case distribution suggest An. albimanus is the primary malaria vector in Panama, confirmed by identification of nine P. vivax-infected specimen pools. Future malaria eradication strategies in Panama should focus on indigenous comarcas and include both active surveillance for cases and comprehensive anopheline vector surveys.","This research was supported by the Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation of Panama (SENACYT) research grants COL11-044 and ITE10-015 and the National Research Investigator Board (SNI) prize awarded to JRL, and the National Institutes of Health grant R01 A154139 to JEC.

However, an unaided swimmer or diver struggles to navigate precisely over larger extents with consistent image overlap needed for visual reconstruction. While underwater robots have demonstrated systematic coverage of areas much larger than the footprint of a single image, access to suitable robotic systems is limited and requires specialized operators. Furthermore, robots are poor at navigating hydrodynamic habitats such as shallow coral reefs. We present a simple approach that constrains the motion of a swimmer using a line unwinding from a fixed central drum. The resulting motion is the involute of a circle, a spiral-like path with constant spacing between revolutions. We test this survey method at a broad range of habitats and hydrodynamic conditions encircling Lizard Island in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The approach generates fast, structured, repeatable, and large-extent surveys (~110 m2 in 15 min) that can be performed with two people and are superior to the commonly used ""mow the lawn"" method. The amount of image overlap is a design parameter, allowing for surveys that can then be reliably used in an automated processing pipeline to generate 3D reconstructions, orthographically projected mosaics, and structural complexity indices. The individual images or full mosaics can also be labeled for benthic diversity and cover estimates. The survey method we present can serve as a standard approach to repeatedly collecting underwater imagery for high-resolution 2D mosaics and 3D reconstructions covering spatial extents much larger than a single image footprint without requiring sophisticated robotic systems or lengthy deployment of visual guides. As such, it opens up cost-effective novel observations to inform studies relating habitat structure to ecological processes and biodiversity at scales and spatial resolutions not readily available previously.","Acknowledgments Research in this study was supported by the Australian Research Council grants DP1093448 and FT110100609 and the University of Sydney.

Given these biogeographic patterns, an interesting region to study their diversity is Central America and the Caribbean, since the region is closely connected to and often considered a part of the North American continent, but biogeographically belong to the Neotropical realm, and comprises several regions with different geologic histories. Based on a multi-gene phylogeny and morphological study, this study shows that Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean harbour at least 35 Lactifluus species, of which 33 were never reported outside of this region. It was found that species from the Caribbean generally show affinities to South American taxa, while species from the Central American mainland generally show affinities to Northern hemispheric taxa. We hypothesise that host specificity and/or climate play a crucial role in these different origins of diversity. Because of these different affinities, Caribbean islands harbour a completely different Lactifluus diversity than the Central American mainland. The majority of species occurring on the islands can be considered endemic to certain islands or island groups. In this paper, detailed morphological descriptions are given, with a focus on the unique diversity of the islands, and identification keys to all hitherto described Lactifluus species occurring in Central America and the Caribbean are provided. One new section, Lactifluus sect. Nebulosi, and three new species, Lactifluus guadeloupensis, Lactifluus lepus and Lactifluus marmoratus are described.","The first author was funded by a doctoral scholarship of the Special Research Fund (BOF, grant BOF-DOC-2015-007001).

Commonly, the analysis of environmental influences on the expression of muscle-related gene regulators in teleosts is based on differences in swimming performance, feeding behaviour and stress-resistance, but the evaluation of behavioural phenotyping of immune and stress-related responsiveness in skeletal muscle is still scarce. Here we challenge proactive and reactive fingerlings of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), one of the most commonly cultured species in the Mediterranean area, with highly pathogenic O1, O2α and O2β serotypes of Vibrio anguillarum, a widespread opportunistic pathogen of marine animals, to analyse skeletal muscle responses to bath vaccination. Transcripts related to inflammation (interleukin 1β, il1β; tumour necrosis factor-α, tnfα; and immunoglobulin M, igm), and muscle metabolism and growth (lipoprotein, lpl; myostatin, mstn-1; myogenin; and growth hormone receptors type I and II, ghr1 and ghr2, respectively) were analysed. Biochemical indicators of muscle metabolism and function (creatine kinase, CK, aspartate aminotransferase, AST; esterase activity, EA; total antioxidant status, TAC and glucose) were also determined. Our results indicate that proactive, but not reactive, fish respond to Vibrio vaccination by increasing the expression levels of mstn-1, myogenin and ghr2 transcripts at short-/medium- term (1 to 3 days' post vaccination). No effect of vaccination was observed in immune indicators or biochemical parameters in either phenotypes, except for elevated levels of EA in reactive fish one-week post vaccination. This suggests that behavioural divergence should be taken into account to evaluate the crosstalk between immune, metabolic and growth processes in muscle of immune-challenged fish.","This research was supported through the “Plan Estatal de Investigación”, Government of Spain and UE-FEDER funds (AGL2016-76069-C2-2-R) and by “Determinación de indicadores de respuesta primaria secundaria al estrés y su relación con personalidad animal” (SENACYT, APY-GC-2016-04, Gobierno de Panamá.

We studied the effects of multiple stressors associated with agricultural practices (pesticide toxicity, nutrient enrichment and habitat alteration-quantified as TUmax, soluble reactive phosphorus concentration and sedimentation, respectively) on macroinvertebrate communities in a tropical catchment in Panama (13 stream sites sampled in 20 occasions from 2015 to 2017, with 260 samples in total). We examined how macroinvertebrate abundance, taxonomic richness, community composition and biotic indices (SPEAR and BMWP/PAN, which were specifically designed to detect pesticide toxicity and nutrient enrichment, respectively) varied depending on the studied stressors, considering their single and combined effects. Our analyses revealed significant effects of the studied stressors on macroinvertebrate communities, with two particular results that merit further attention: (1) the fact that pesticide toxicity affected BMWP/PAN, but not SPEAR, possibly because the former had been adapted for local fauna; and (2) that most stressors showed antagonistic interactions (i.e., lower combined effects than expected from their individual effects). These results highlight the need for toxicity bioassays with tropical species that allow adaptations of biotic indices, and of observational and manipulative studies exploring the combined effects of multiple stressors on tropical macroinvertebrate communities and ecosystems, in order to predict and manage future anthropogenic impacts on tropical streams.","This study was part of AC’s PhD thesis and TR’s MSc thesis, both supported by the ARCAL RLA7019 project led by the MIDA and funded by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Conflicts may emerge from several processes including paralogy, hybridization, and incomplete lineage sorting. Although phylogenetic incongruence appears common, its impact on many phylogeny-based analyses remains poorly understood.
METHODS: We examined the occurrence of phylogenetic conflict between nuclear (ribosome ITS) and plastid (rbcL, trnL-F, rpl20-rps12, and rps16 intron) loci in the ancient angiosperm family Chloranthaceae. Then we investigated how phylogenetic conflict bears on taxonomic classification within the family as well as on inferences on biogeographical history, floral evolution, and measures of phylogenetic diversity (PD).
KEY RESULTS: We found evidence for significant phylogenetic incongruence between plastid and nuclear data in the genus Hedyosmum. Within Hedyosmum, our results did not support previous subgeneric classification of the genus. Division of sections within subgenus Tafalla was supported by the ITS data but not by the plastid data set. As a consequence, we showed that inferring the evolution of key floral characters and geographical history within Hedyosmum depends on the phylogenetic data used. Both data sets yielded similar PD measures across genera, but we found contrasting PD measures in Hedyosmum, even after correcting for rate heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that phylogenetic conflict not only affects the inference of organismal relationships but also impacts our understanding of biogeographical history, morphological evolution, and phylogenetic diversity.",,,American Journal of Botany,,,"Cell Nucleus; Chloroplast Proteins; Evolution, Molecular; Flowers; Magnoliopsida; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Dispersal; Sequence Analysis, DNA",2015-04,2015,2015-04,2015-04,102,4,566-580,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Zhang, Qiang; Feild, Taylor S.; Antonelli, Alexandre","Zhang, Qiang (Guangxi Key Laboratory of Plant Conservation and Restoration Ecology in Karst Terrain, Guangxi Institute of Botany, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Chinese Academy of Sciences 541006, Guilin, China); Feild, Taylor S.

Latrine samples were analyzed for temperature, pH, % moisture, carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio, and presence of specific pathogens. Surveys and visual inspections were used to verify use and type of dry material desiccant added. Measurements supported findings that compost latrines do not reach temperatures sufficient to destroy all pathogens. pH measurements showed that many latrines were operating within the range for ideal aerobic decomposition, a pH of 7.5-8.5, but only 17% of latrines measured pH 9 or above. Almost 100% of composting latrine users added sawdust and wood ash, to lower moisture level and provide carbon for decomposition. However, the recommended amount of desiccant added was insufficient to reduce moisture to the suggested 25% for pathogen destruction and C/N ratios remained in the range of raw human faeces. Importantly, pathogens, mainly helminths, were still present in compost stored for the 6-month contact time. The latrines have conflicting goals of pathogen destruction and aerobic decomposition. Recommendations are made regarding operation of composting latrines and disposal of composted material.",,,Journal of Water and Health,,,"Animals; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon; Entamoeba; Feces; Giardia lamblia; Helminths; Humans; Hygroscopic Agents; Nitrogen; Panama; Soil; Temperature; Toilet Facilities",2011-02-03,2011,2011-02-03,2011-03-01,9,1,187-199,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Mehl, Jessica; Kaiser, Josephine; Hurtado, Daniel; Gibson, Daragh A.; Izurieta, Ricardo; Mihelcic, James R.","Mehl, Jessica (Civil & Environmental Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, Michigan, 49931, USA); Kaiser, Josephine (Civil & Environmental Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, Michigan, 49931, USA); Hurtado, Daniel (Civil & Environmental Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, Michigan, 49931, USA); Gibson, Daragh A.

However, considering the currently discussed more flexible approach to define mesophotic boundaries, based on light availability, we performed a systematic search to assess their current state of knowledge. Using MODIS-Aqua satellite data (Kd490), we calculated the mesophotic boundaries in the ETP, based on optical depths, and performed a bibliographic search of studies carried out at those depths, including those present in turbid waters with KdPAR values up to 0.2 m-1. Seventy-seven papers on MCEs research were compiled in this review, recording a total of 138 species. The studies focus almost exclusively on taxonomy, ecosystem function, and reviews, indicating the need for future research regarding aspects, such as structuring environmental variables, molecular ecology, and natural resource management. Furthermore, remote sensing data show that there exists a high spatial variability of water transparency in the ETP, resulting in significant differences in KdPAR between oceanic and continental locations, mostly related to the occurrence of seasonal upwelling in the latter. Based on KdPAR, we estimated the mesophotic depth boundaries (z10%, z1%, z0.1%) for specific locations within the ETP and found that MCEs can potentially occur as shallow as 13-15 m in coastal regions. Also, we compared the calculated boundaries with the respective deepest records of light-dependent corals. With one exception, the presence of the corals was restricted to the upper mesophotic subzone (z10%-z1%), which agrees with reports for other regions, showing that light availability is one of the main drivers for the bathymetric distribution of MCEs and can be used as a first approach to identify their potential presence, though other local factors (e.g., geomorphology, temperature, internal waves) should also be considered, as they can cause shifts in depth limits.","We appreciate the comments of F.

The species showed moderate genetic diversity (π=0.0045) and phylogeographic structure (Φ(ST)=0.12-0.95). The phylogeographic pattern indicated the Nicaragua Depression has prevented gene flow whereas populations on the two sides of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec did not show strong genetic differentiation. In Mexico, the population of the Sierra Madre Oriental was composed of two different lineages. In general, our data did not support a scenario of historical demographic expansion, and matched partially the phylogeographic patterns of other Mesoamerica montane species.","AcknowledgmentsThanks to CONACyT (Scholarship 10926), the Posgrado en Ciencias Biológicas-UNAM, and DGEP-UNAM for providing funding and facilities to EAC to develop graduate studies at UNAM.

The present study examined reinfection dynamics and spatial clustering of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm in an extremely impoverished indigenous setting in rural Panamá over a 16 month period that included two treatment and reinfection cycles in preschool children.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Spatial cluster analyses were used to identify high prevalence clusters for each nematode. Multivariate models were then used (1) to identify factors that differentiated households within and outside the cluster, and (2) to examine the relative contribution of regional (presence in a high prevalence cluster), household (household density, asset-based household wealth, household crowding, maternal education) and individual (age, sex, pre-treatment eggs per gram (epg) feces, height-for-age, latrine use) factors on preschool child reinfection epgs for each STH. High prevalence spatial clusters were detected for Trichuris and hookworm but not for Ascaris. These clusters were characterized by low household density and low household wealth indices (HWI). Reinfection epg of both hookworm and Ascaris was positively associated with pre-treatment epg and was higher in stunted children. Additional individual (latrine use) as well as household variables (HWI, maternal education) entered the reinfection models for Ascaris but not for hookworm.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Even within the context of extreme poverty in this remote rural setting, the distinct transmission patterns for hookworm, Trichuris and Ascaris highlight the need for multi-pronged intervention strategies. In addition to poverty reduction, improved sanitation and attention to chronic malnutrition will be key to reducing Ascaris and hookworm transmission.","This research was supported by the Canadian International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (SENACYT) of Panamá.

2050,pub.1127540344,10.1038/s41596-020-0317-5,32405051,,Reproducible molecular networking of untargeted mass spectrometry data using GNPS,"Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) is an interactive online small molecule–focused tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) data curation and analysis infrastructure. It is intended to provide as much chemical insight as possible into an untargeted MS2 dataset and to connect this chemical insight to the user’s underlying biological questions. This can be performed within one liquid chromatography (LC)-MS2 experiment or at the repository scale. GNPS-MassIVE is a public data repository for untargeted MS2 data with sample information (metadata) and annotated MS2 spectra. These publicly accessible data can be annotated and updated with the GNPS infrastructure keeping a continuous record of all changes. This knowledge is disseminated across all public data; it is a living dataset. Molecular networking—one of the main analysis tools used within the GNPS platform—creates a structured data table that reflects the molecular diversity captured in tandem mass spectrometry experiments by computing the relationships of the MS2 spectra as spectral similarity. This protocol provides step-by-step instructions for creating reproducible, high-quality molecular networks. For training purposes, the reader is led through a 90- to 120-min procedure that starts by recalling an example public dataset and its sample information and proceeds to creating and interpreting a molecular network. Each data analysis job can be shared or cloned to disseminate the knowledge gained, thus propagating information that can lead to the discovery of molecules, metabolic pathways, and ecosystem/community interactions.","We acknowledge funding from the following: National Research System (SNI) of SENACYT Panama (C.A.B.P., M.H.C., J.L.-B., and M.G.); the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (P.C.D., N.B., and K.L.M.); the National Institutes of Health (GM122016-01; K.L.M.); the National Science Foundation (DEB1354944; R.M.T.) and (IOS-1656481; A.M.C.R and P.C.D).

Occasionally, bleached corals become exceptionally colorful rather than white. These colors derive from photoprotective green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like pigments produced by the coral host. There is currently no consensus regarding what causes colorful bleaching events and what the consequences for the corals are. Here, we document that colorful bleaching events are a recurring phenomenon in reef regions around the globe. Our analysis of temperature conditions associated with colorful bleaching events suggests that corals develop extreme coloration within 2 to 3 weeks after exposure to mild or temporary heat stress. We demonstrate that the increase of light fluxes in symbiont-depleted tissue promoted by reflection of the incident light from the coral skeleton induces strong expression of the photoprotective coral host pigments. We describe an optical feedback loop involving both partners of the association, discussing that the mitigation of light stress offered by host pigments could facilitate recolonization of bleached tissue by symbionts. Our data indicate that colorful bleaching has the potential to identify local environmental factors, such as nutrient stress, that can exacerbate the impact of elevated temperatures on corals, to indicate the severity of heat stress experienced by corals and to gauge their post-stress recovery potential.

Previous studies based on molecular data recommended changes in the taxonomy of the group. In particular, R. microdon has been the most taxonomically questioned, with the suggestion that it constitutes a complex of cryptic species. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of the R. tenuirostris species group using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial Cytochrome b gene and Intron 7 of the nuclear beta fibrinogen gene. In addition, divergence times were estimated, and possible new taxa delimited with three widely used species delimitation methods. Finally, possible connectivity routes based on shared haplotypes were tested among the R. microdon populations. All species were recovered as monophyletic with the exception of R. microdon, whose individuals were grouped into four different haplogroups, one of which included specimens of R. bakeri. Diversification within the R. tenuirostris species group began about 3 Ma, in the Pleistocene. The bGMYC and STACEY delimitation methods were congruent with each other, delimiting at the species-level each haplogroup within R. microdon, while the mPTP suggested a greater number of species. Moreover, none of the haplogroups showed potential connectivity routes between them, evidencing lack of gene flow. Our results suggest the existence of a higher number of species in the R. tenuirostris group, because we show that there are four species within what is currently recognized as R. microdon.","We thank the following institutions for providing tissue loans: Colección Nacional de Mamíferos, UNAM (F.

Here we integrate analyses of coral reef benthic communities with microbial community sequencing to show how a deoxygenation event rapidly altered benthic community composition and microbial assemblages in a shallow tropical reef ecosystem. Conditions associated with the event precipitated coral bleaching and mass mortality, causing a 50% loss of live coral and a shift in the benthic community that persisted a year later. Conversely, the unique taxonomic and functional profile of hypoxia-associated microbes rapidly reverted to a normoxic assemblage one month after the event. The decoupling of ecological trajectories among these major functional groups following an acute event emphasizes the need to incorporate deoxygenation as an emerging stressor into coral reef research and management plans to combat escalating threats to reef persistence.","M.D.J. was funded by postdoctoral fellow awards from the Smithsonian Institution’s Marine Global Earth Observatory (MarineGEO) and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI); M.L. and N.L. were funded by postdoctoral support from the STRI Office of Fellowships.

Because of the distribution of this genus, it could be hypothesized that the evolutionary patterns in this genus, including a pair of geminate species across the Central American Isthmus, could be explained by vicariance following the break-up of Gondwana. However, the evolutionary history of this group has not been evaluated. We constructed a time-scaled molecular phylogeny of Dormitator using mitochondrial (Cytochrome b) and nuclear (Rhodopsin and β-actin) DNA sequence data to infer and date the cladogenetic events that drove the diversification of the genus and to relate them to the biogeographical history of Central America. Two divergent lineages of Dormitator were recovered: one that included all of the Pacific samples and another that included all of the eastern and western Atlantic samples. In contrast to the Pacific lineage, which showed no phylogeographic structure, the Atlantic lineage was geographically structured into four clades: Cameroon, Gulf of Mexico, West Cuba and Caribbean, showing evidence of potential cryptic species. The separation of the Pacific and Atlantic lineages was estimated to have occurred ~1 million years ago (Mya), whereas the four Atlantic clades showed mean times of divergence between 0.2 and 0.4 Mya. The splitting times of Dormitator between ocean basins are similar to those estimated for other geminate species pairs with shoreline estuarine preferences, which may indicate that the common evolutionary histories of the different clades are the result of isolation events associated with the closure of the Central American Isthmus and the subsequent climatic and oceanographic changes.","The authors are grateful for the following financial support for this research: CIC-UMSNH (2010, 2011) and PIFI-UMSNH program (Mexico) to ODD; PAPIIT-UNAM No. IN207213 and CONACyT No. 179048 (Mexico) to MGV; Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales-CSIC and Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness No. CGL2013-41375-P (Spain) to ID; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (Panama) to EB; CONACyT PhD scholarship No. 216640 granted to SGQ.

In this study, we analyzed patterns of distribution of red oaks (Quercus, section Lobatae) occurring in Mexico and Central America to determine areas of species richness and endemism to propose areas of conservation.
METHODS: Patterns of richness and endemism of 75 red oak species were analyzed using three different units. Two complementarity algorithms based on species richness and three algorithms based on species rarity were used to identify important areas for conservation. A simulated annealing analysis was performed to evaluate and formulate effective new reserves for red oaks that are useful for conserving the ecosystems associated with them after the systematic conservation planning approach.
KEY RESULTS: Two main centers of species richness were detected. The northern Sierra Madre Oriental and Serranías Meridionales of Jalisco had the highest values of endemism. Fourteen areas were considered as priorities for conservation of red oak species based on the 26 priority political entities, 11 floristic units and the priority grid-cells obtained in the complementarity analysis. In the present network of Natural Protected Areas in Mexico and Central America, only 41.3% (31 species) of the red oak species are protected. The simulated annealing analysis indicated that to protect all 75 species of red oaks, 12 current natural protected areas need to be expanded by 120000 ha of additional land, and 26 new natural protected areas with 512500 ha need to be created.
CONCLUSIONS: Red oaks are a useful model to identify areas for conservation based on species richness and endemism as a result of their wide geographic distribution and a high number of species. We evaluated and reformulated new reserves for red oaks that are also useful for the conservation of ecosystems associated with them.",,,American Journal of Botany,,,"Algorithms; Biodiversity; Central America; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Mexico; Models, Theoretical; Quercus; Species Specificity; Trees",2011-02,2011,2011-02,2011-02,98,2,290-305,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Torres‐Miranda, Andrés; Luna‐Vega, Isolda; Oyama, Ken","Torres‐Miranda, Andrés (Centro de Investigaciones en Ecosistemas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), Ant.

A review,"In Latin America, the cultivation of Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) plays a critical role in rural livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development. Over the last 20 years, coffee farms and landscapes across the region have undergone rapid and profound biophysical changes in response to low coffee prices, changing climatic conditions, severe plant pathogen outbreaks, and other drivers. Although these biophysical transformations are pervasive and affect millions of rural livelihoods, there is limited information on the types, location, and extent of landscape changes and their socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Here we review the state of knowledge on the ongoing biophysical changes in coffee-growing regions, explore the potential socioeconomic and ecological impacts of these changes, and highlight key research gaps. We identify seven major land-use trends which are affecting the sustainability of coffee-growing regions across Latin America in different ways. These trends include (1) the widespread shift to disease-resistant cultivars, (2) the conventional intensification of coffee management with greater planting densities, greater use of agrochemicals and less shade, (3) the conversion of coffee to other agricultural land uses, (4) the introduction of Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora) into areas not previously cultivated with coffee, (5) the expansion of coffee into forested areas, (6) the urbanization of coffee landscapes, and (7) the increase in the area of coffee produced under voluntary sustainability standards. Our review highlights the incomplete and scattered information on the drivers, patterns, and outcomes of biophysical changes in coffee landscapes, and lays out a detailed research agenda to address these research gaps and elucidate the effects of different landscape trajectories on rural livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and other aspects of sustainable development. A better understanding of the drivers, patterns, and consequences of changes in coffee landscapes is vital for informing the design of policies, programs, and incentives for sustainable coffee production.","We thank Sophie Alvarez (facilitator) and Jesús Eymer Meneses from Federación Campesina de Cauca for their contributions to the workshop, and Jeffrey Milder for providing information on coffee certification.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationships and boundaries among Eastern Pacific Aplysina species using morphological, biochemical and molecular data. For this, a collection of sponges of the genus Aplysina from the Mexican Pacific was studied on the basis of their morphological, chemical (chitin composition), and molecular markers (mitochondrial COI and nuclear ribosomal rDNA: ITS1-5.8-ITS2). Three morphological species were identified, two of which are new to science. A. clathrata sp. nov. is a yellow to yellow-reddish or -brownish sponge, characterized by external clathrate-like morphology; A. revillagigedi sp. nov. is a lemon yellow to green, cushion-shaped sometimes lobate sponge, characterized by conspicuous oscules, which are slightly elevated and usually linearly distributed on rims; and A. gerardogreeni a known species distributed along the Mexican Pacific coast. Chitin was identified as the main structural component within skeletons of the three species using FTIR, confirming that it is shared among Verongida sponges. Morphological differences were confirmed by DNA sequences from nuclear ITS1-5.8-ITS2. Mitochondrial COI sequences showed extremely low but diagnostic variability for Aplysina revillagigedi sp. nov., thus our results corroborate that COI has limited power for DNA-barcoding of sponges and should be complemented with other markers (e.g. rDNA). Phylogenetic analyses of Aplysina sequences from the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean, resolved two allopatric and reciprocally monophyletic groups for each region. Eastern Pacific species were grouped in general accordance with the taxonomic hypothesis based on morphological characters. An identification key of Eastern Pacific Aplysina species is presented. Our results constitute one of the first approximations to integrative taxonomy, phylogeny and evolutionary biogeography of Eastern Pacific marine sponges; an approach that will significantly contribute to our better understanding of their diversity and evolutionary history.","This research has been supported by the projects SEP-CONACYT-102239, SEMARNAT-CONACYT-23390, PAPIT-IT209311-3 and IACOD-IB200711 (CONACYT = Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, SEP = Secretaria de Educación Pública, SEMARNAT = Secretaria de medio ambiente y recursos naturales, PAPIT = Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigación e Innovación Tecnológica, IACOD = Iniciativa de Apoyo complementario a la realización de Obras Determinadas).

Here, we report taxonomical conclusions based on multiple species delimitation and validation analyses performed on an eight-locus dataset that includes world-wide representatives of the dolichorhizoid and scabrosoid clades in section Polydactylon of the genus Peltigera. Following the recommendations resulting from a consensus species delimitation approach and additional species validation analysis (BPP) performed in this study, we present a total of 25 species in the dolichorhizoid clade and nine in the scabrosoid clade, including respectively 18 and six species that are new to science and formally described. Additionally, one combination and three varieties (including two new to science) are proposed in the dolichorhizoid clade. The following 24 new species are described: P. appalachiensis, P. asiatica, P. borealis, P. borinquensis, P. chabanenkoae, P. clathrata, P. elixii, P. esslingeri, P. flabellae, P. gallowayi, P. hawaiiensis, P. holtanhartwigii, P. itatiaiae, P. hokkaidoensis, P. kukwae, P. massonii, P. mikado, P. nigriventris, P. orientalis, P. rangiferina, P. sipmanii, P. stanleyensis, P. vitikainenii and P. willdenowii; the following new varieties are introduced: P. kukwae var. phyllidiata and P. truculenta var. austroscabrosa; and the following new combination is introduced: P. hymenina var. dissecta. Each species from the dolichorhizoid and scabrosoid clades is morphologically and chemically described, illustrated, and characterised with ITS sequences. Identification keys are provided for the main biogeographic regions where species from the two clades occur. Morphological and chemical characters that are commonly used for species identification in the genus Peltigera cannot be applied to unambiguously recognise most molecularly circumscribed species, due to high variation of thalli formed by individuals within a fungal species, including the presence of distinct morphs in some cases, or low interspecific variation in others. The four commonly recognised morphospecies: P. dolichorhiza, P. neopolydactyla, P. pulverulenta and P. scabrosa in the dolichorhizoid and scabrosoid clades represent species complexes spread across multiple and often phylogenetically distantly related lineages. Geographic origin of specimens is often helpful for species recognition; however, ITS sequences are frequently required for a reliable identification.

Here, we use a genetic seascape approach and ecological niche modeling to unravel the environmental factors correlating with the genetic variation of Porites panamensis, a hermatypic coral endemic to the ETP. Specifically, we test if levels of diversity and connectivity are higher among abundant than among depauperate populations, as expected by a geographically relaxed version of the Abundant Center Hypothesis (rel-ACH). Unlike the original ACH, referring to a geographical center of distribution of maximal abundance, the rel-ACH refers only to a center of maximum abundance, irrespective of its geographic position. The patterns of relative abundance of P. panamensis in the Mexican Pacific revealed that northern populations from Baja California represent its center of abundance; and southern depauperate populations along the continental margin are peripheral relative to it. Genetic patterns of diversity and structure of nuclear DNA sequences (ribosomal DNA and a single copy open reading frame) and five alloenzymatic loci partially agreed with rel-ACH predictions. We found higher diversity levels in peninsular populations and significant differentiation between peninsular and continental colonies. In addition, continental populations showed higher levels of differentiation and lower connectivity than peninsular populations in the absence of isolation by distance in each region. Some discrepancies with model expectations may relate to the influence of significant habitat discontinuities in the face of limited dispersal potential. Environmental data analyses and niche modeling allowed us to identify temperature, water clarity, and substrate availability as the main factors correlating with patterns of abundance, genetic diversity, and structure, which may hold the key to the survival of P. panamensis in the face of widespread environmental degradation.","Acknowledgments We gratefully acknowledge the team of collaborators along the Gulf of California and the tropical Mexican Pacific for their assistance in surveys and sample collections (UABCS, CIBNOR, ICMyL‐UNAM Mazatlán, CUC‐U de G, and UMAR), a special thanks to Rafael Cabral, Eduardo F.

Thus, knowing the identity, diversity, host–pathogen relationships, and geographic distribution of rodent-borne zoonotic pathogens, is essential for predicting and mitigating zoonotic disease outbreaks. Hantaviruses are hosted by numerous rodent reservoirs. However, the diversity of rodents harboring hantaviruses is likely unknown because research is biased toward specific reservoir hosts and viruses. An up-to-date, systematic review covering all known rodent hosts is lacking. Herein, we document gaps in our knowledge of the diversity and distribution of rodent species that host hantaviruses. Of the currently recognized 681 cricetid, 730 murid, 61 nesomyid, and 278 sciurid species, we determined that 11.3, 2.1, 1.6, and 1.1%, respectively, have known associations with hantaviruses. The diversity of hantaviruses hosted by rodents and their distribution among host species supports a reassessment of the paradigm that each virus is associated with a single-host species. We examine these host–virus associations on a global taxonomic and geographical scale with emphasis on the rodent host diversity and distribution. Previous reviews have been centered on the viruses and not the mammalian hosts. Thus, we provide a perspective not previously addressed.",,,EcoHealth,,,Animals; Disease Reservoirs; Orthohantavirus; Rodentia; Zoonoses,2018-03,2018,2018-04-30,2018-03,15,1,163-208,Closed,Article,"Milholland, Matthew T.; Castro-Arellano, Iván; Suzán, Gerardo; Garcia-Peña, Gabriel E.; Lee, Thomas E.; Rohde, Rodney E.; Alonso Aguirre, A.; Mills, James N.","Milholland, Matthew T.

People living with HIV (PLHIV) are sexually active and also HIV can be transmitted while trying to achieve pregnancy involving unprotected hetero-sexual intercourse. Fertility desire among PLHIV is increasing due to improved quality of life and survival following commencement of anti-retroviral treatment and available reproductive health services. The objective of the study was to determine the association between knowledge on MTCT of HIV and sexuality and fertility desire.
METHODS: this study was descriptive cross-sectional applying systematic sampling technique among PLHIV using semi-structured interviewer administered questionnaires. Data was analysed using SPSS version 23.0. Chi square test was used for statistical analysis. At 95% confidence interval a P-value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS: a total of 168 PLHIV were studied, 63.3% females and 36.7% males. Majority (81.5%) of the respondents were sexually active and 64.1% had fertility desire. On awareness of MTCT 62.5% had heard of MTCT but only 28.2% had good knowledge. No association was found between knowledge of MTCT and sexuality and fertility desire respectively.
CONCLUSION: PLHIV had high awareness but poor knowledge on MTCT of HIV, hence the need for healthcare workers to provide sexual and reproductive health counselling including information on MTCT to both male and female PLHIV during routine clinic visits.",The authors are grateful to the respondents and also research assists who participated in data collection.,,Pan African Medical Journal,,,"Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; HIV Infections; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Male; Middle Aged; Nigeria; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Sexual Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2021,2021,2021,,40,64,64,All OA; Gold,Article,"Amaike, Chikwendu; Afolaranmi, Tolulope Olumide; Amaike, Blessing Adaku; Agbo, Hadiza; Abiodun, Olumide","Amaike, Chikwendu (Department of Community Medicine, College of Health and Medical Sciences, Babcock University, Ilishan Remo, Ogun State, Nigeria,; Seventh-Day Adventist Hospital, Jengre, Plateau State, Nigeria,); Afolaranmi, Tolulope Olumide (Department of Community Medicine, University of Jos and Jos University Teaching Hospital, Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria,); Amaike, Blessing Adaku (Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria); Agbo, Hadiza (Department of Community Medicine, University of Jos and Jos University Teaching Hospital, Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria,); Abiodun, Olumide (Department of Community Medicine, College of Health and Medical Sciences, Babcock University, Ilishan Remo, Ogun State, Nigeria,)","Amaike, Chikwendu (Babcock University; Seventh-Day Adventist Hospital, Jengre, Plateau State, Nigeria,)","Amaike, Chikwendu (Babcock University; Seventh-Day Adventist Hospital, Jengre, Plateau State, Nigeria,); Afolaranmi, Tolulope Olumide (Jos University Teaching Hospital); Amaike, Blessing Adaku (University of Jos); Agbo, Hadiza (Jos University Teaching Hospital); Abiodun, Olumide (Babcock University)",1,1,,0.49,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2021.40.64.31455,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141459608,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Low abundance and low species numbers in lowland rain forests are most likely due to reduced diurnal activity times combined with high nocturnal respiration rates at high temperatures. This may exclude many montane species from the warm lowlands. However, an alternative hypothesis explains the observed pattern, namely a limited desiccation tolerance of montane species, precipitation being more concentrated but less frequent in most lowland forests compared to montane cloud forests. To test this hypothesis, we studied the desiccation tolerance of four montane and four lowland bryophyte species. The effects of prolonged drought were quantified with chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) and the extent of electrolyte leakage. Both montane and lowland species survived dry periods of ≧80 days, which far exceeds the duration of dry periods in the wet lowland tropics. We can thus exclude intolerance to long dry spells as an explaination for the absence of the tested montane species in the lowlands. We should continue to focus on other mechanisms to explain the altitudinal gradient of bryophyte abundance and diversity in the tropics, in order to understand this pattern, as well as to predict future trends under climatic warming.","We thank Noris Salazar Allen for help with species identification, and the staff of the STRI Research Station in Bocas del Toro and of the Autonomous University of Chiriquí (UNACHI) for their support and facilities.

However, evidence suggests that economic interests are increasingly being prioritized over the environment and the livelihoods of local resource-dependent communities. This review consists of four case studies from key coastal regions in Panama, exploring the successes and failures of different approaches to resource management and the impacts of management on the complex socio-ecological interactions between people and their environment. Primarily, we describe how communication and interaction between stakeholders are critical to effective coastal resource conservation. Panama provides an example of a complex sociological web attempting to balance a developing economy with the needs of a diverse and often marginalized population. While there is consensus surrounding the need for environmental management efforts, ineffective communication, community engagement, and knowledge exchange have severely impaired success. Overall, we highlight the importance of effective knowledge collection and exchange. For example, effectively utilizing the extensive historical and cultural heritage within the Panamanian indigenous societies would help to encourage stronger cooperation between policymakers and local communities.

As an example, gibberellin (GA) growth phytohormones can be obtained by such means, wherein gibberellic acid (GA3) is of great interest worldwide in the agricultural sector. The central aspect of this research therefore focused on the bioconversion of agricultural by-products, such as corn cob, to obtain GA3 phytohormone via solid-state fermentation (SSF) with Aspergillus niger. The chemical characterization of the obtained material showed that the corn cob possessed glucose, mannose, arabinose, and lignin contents of 34, 26, 8, and 16%, respectively. Our results also indicated an appreciable carbon content (47%), in addition to the mineral elements of nitrogen (4%), potassium (1.2%), iron (0.03%), sodium (0.01%), calcium (0.06%), and Al (0.02%). Following SSF for 11 d in the presence of A. niger at pH 5, 30°C, and 24% sample consistency, a GA3 production of >6.1 g·kg−1 was obtained. This value is higher than those previously reported for different by-products of the food industry, such as coffee husk, wheat bran, cassava, pea pods, and sorghum straw (i.e., 0.25–5.5 g·kg−1) following SSF. The production of GA3 from corn cob residues not only contributes to reducing the negative impact of agricultural by-products but also represents a new source of a key raw material for phytohormone production, thereby contributing to the development of processes to convert agricultural residues into biologically active compounds of commercial interest.","The authors thank the analysts Glenda Maldonado and Samuel Flores and PhD.

In February 2006 these technologies were deployed along the Western Isthmus of Panamá. Over the course of two weeks, chemical (CTD, fluorometry, and in-situ mass spectrometry) and acoustic bathymetric transects mapped approximately 300km, collecting over 25,000 chemical samples, with spatial resolution on the order of 10 meters. Automated seafloor imaging successfully mapped another 5km of seafloor habitats, with resolution on the order of 1 cm. The results from these surveys provide insight into reef structure, bathymetry, spatial heterogeneity of marine organisms, and fundamental metabolic processes of photosynthesis and respiration. This information has proven useful for understanding both natural and human dynamics affecting tropical reef systems within the eastern Pacific Ocean.

This does not, however, include everything they have done or can do. Navies have always spent much of their time and resources engaged in operations that fall outside the traditional definitions of sea power. These activities have at times contributed far more to their respective nations’ security and prosperity than kinetic actions but receive far less attention than their benefits merit. In this book, an international collection of historians and strategists share new, or re-learned, perspectives to serve as inspiration for further study and to broaden the discussion on what naval forces can do and be.

Ast. formosensis, Meliola indica, and M. pisoniae, previously known only from Asia, and M. dissotidis hitherto known only from Africa. Six species of plants are cited as hosts for meliolaceous fungi for the first time. In a phylogenetic hypothesis based on 28S nrDNA sequences, the position of Meliolales, including Appendiculella, Asteridiella, Endomeliola, Irenopsis, and Meliola, is found to be basal to Sordariomycetidae, Hypocreomycetidae, and Xylariomycetidae within Sordariomycetes. The five genera of Meliolaceae form a strongly supported clade. We suggest adopting the concept of the subclass Meliolomycetidae. The monophyly of Asteridiella cannot be confirmed. A hypothetical close relationship between Asteridiella and Appendiculella is not supported, but Endomeliola appears closely related to a species of Asteridiella.

It leverages LoRa modulation technology derived from the Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) to enable efficient and reliable connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. With its ability to achieve an extended range and operate with ultralow power consumption, LoRaWan has gained significant attention for various applications including environmental monitoring. This study focused on the design and implementation of a LoRaWAN network for environmental sensing and monitoring. The network architecture incorporates the integration of sensors, utilization of LoRa gateways, and deployment of LoRaWAN infrastructure. The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the LoRa signal strength and coverage, collect environmental data using LoRaWAN-connected sensors, and analyze the gathered data to derive meaningful insights for environmental monitoring applications. The experiments offer valuable comparisons with previous studies, emphasizing the diverse performance levels of LoRa within a range of 750-1,000 meters. By investigating the performance and coverage of LoRaWAN, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of LoRa technology for environmental monitoring applications. The findings of this study have implications for the design and optimization of LoRaWAN networks, demonstrating the potential of LoRaWan in enabling efficient and scalable environmental sensing technologies.","This work was made possible thanks to the support of the Sistema Nacional de Investigación (SNI-007-2022) and (FlED19-R1–003) of Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Senacyt Panamá.

1090,pub.1053553864,10.4319/lo.2010.55.1.0239,,,Ocean acidification hotspots: Spatiotemporal dynamics of the seawater CO2 system of eastern Pacific coral reefs,"Seawater CO 2 system dynamics were assessed from eastern Pacific reef sites in Panamá over 5 consecutive years (2003‐2008) and twice in the Galápagos Islands (2003 and 2009). The seawater CO 2 system was highly variable in time and space, but was explained by physical forcing from meteorological (seasonal rainfall) and oceanographic (upwelling, tides) processes interacting with diurnal reef metabolism. Galápagos coral reef communities are naturally exposed to the highest ambient partial pressure of CO 2 ( p CO 2 ) and lowest aragonite saturation (Ω arag ) values documented for any coral reef environment to date. During upwelling in the Galápagos, mean p CO 2 2 and mean Ω arag at five different sites ranged from 53.1 to 73.5 Pa and 2.27 to 2.86, respectively. Values of p CO 2 and Ω arag ranged from 21.0 to 48.7 Pa and 2.47 to 4.18, respectively, on the Saboga Reef in the seasonally upwelling Gulf of Panamaá, with the highest p CO 2 and lowest Ω arag values occurring during upwelling. The Uva Reef, in the nonupwelling Gulf of Chiriquí of Pacific Panamá, had mean Ω arag values that were always significantly greater than those at the Saboga Reef. Diurnal changes in the seawater CO 2 system from reef metabolism on the Uva Reef were magnified at low tide and highly significant differences were measured over depths as shallow as 15 m because of the shallow thermocline that is pervasive throughout the eastern Pacific. These naturally high‐CO 2 reefs persist near the Ω arag distributional threshold for coral reefs and are thus expected to be the first and most affected by ocean acidification.",,,Limnology and Oceanography,,,,2009-11-19,2009,2009-11-19,2010-01,55,1,239-248,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Manzello, Derek P.","Manzello, Derek P.

The 24 sampling events yielded approximately 4,000 records of plants corresponding to 311 species as well as 1,614 records of fungi corresponding to approximately 567 species. Lists of more or less certain names of plants and fungi as well as voucher specimens are provided. The randomized species accumulation curve for plants approaches an asymptote and estimators yield stable values of 310–318 predicted plant species in the area of investigation. The curve for records of fungal species, however, did not saturate and all applied estimator functions failed to predict the total richness of fungi for the area convincingly. Two plant collections correspond to new records for Panama and 54 species and infraspecific taxa are new for the Chiriquí province. The identification of fungi is still in process and yielded two species probably new to science as well as 17 new records of species for Panama to date. In order to assess biodiversity patterns (e.g. fungi to plant ratios) of tropical fungi more accurately, it is necessary to repeat such investigations in other areas and to improve the tools for taxonomic identification of these highly diverse but mostly microscopic organisms.","The authors thank numerous students and colleagues who collaborated in the field, namely J.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging technique to assess these tumors, but the large amount of data produced by MRI prevents manual segmentation in a reasonable time, limiting the use of precise quantitative measurements in the clinical practice. Consequently, automatic and reliable segmentation methods are required. However, the large spatial and structural variability among brain tumors make automatic segmentation a challenging problem. In this contribution, we present a new model of segmentation of brain magnetic resonance images. In order to obtain the region of interest, we propose a hybrid approach that carries out both fuzzy c-mean algorithm and multiobjective optimization taking into account both compactness and separation in the clusters with the purpose of improving the cluster center detection and speed up the convergence time. This new segmentation approach is a key component of the proposed magnetic resonance image-based classification system for brain tumors. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach using the DICOM MRI database.","This research is supported by PhD scholarship subprogram SENACYT-IFARHU (Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación y el Instituto para la Formación y Aprovechamiento de Recursos Humanos), CN2070-2013-052, Panamá, Republic of Panama, the scholarship program COOPEN-Erasmus Mundus external cooperation windows: Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain, the Autonomous University of Chiriqui, David, Panama.

When the plant can associate with more than one ant species, the herbivore evasion strategies may either be species-specific, or flexible enough to successfully deter workers of different ant-plant species. Objectives: We studied the behavior of an herbivore bug (Piezogaster reclusus) on ant-defended acacia trees (Vachellia collinsii), which associates with one of three mutualistic Pseudomyrmex ant species, and report the geographical distribution of the acacia bug species of Costa Rica and Panama. Methods: We tested whether herbivore bugs (1) associate with a particular ant species; (2) use chemical or behavioral strategies to evade the ant workers; (3) adjust the evasion strategy to the ant species living on the acacia tree. We also compared collected acacia bugs with Museum specimens to clarify the identification from Costa Rica and Panama. Results: We found bugs more often on trees with ants, particularly Ps. spinicola, and never on trees with Ps. nigrocinctus. To avoid ant attacks, bugs use evasive behaviors to prevent encounters with the ant workers, that depended on the ant species. Also, indirect evidence of intra and interspecific transfer experiments suggest species-specific chemical camouflage or repellence. We also report an expansion of the Southern limit of Pi. reclusus distribution in Central Panama, and reduced the distribution of Pi. chontalesis to the Chiriquí region. Conclusions: Similar to herbivores specialized on chemically defended plants, herbivores on ant-defended trees could evolve specific mechanisms to deal with the plant defenses. However, plants associated with multiple partners are a challenge to herbivore specialization, and might require behavioral plasticity, as our evidence suggests.",,,Revista de Biología Tropical,,,,2020-02-21,2020,2020-02-21,,68,2,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Coronado-Rivera, James; Valle, Marianela Solís-Del; Amador-Vargas, Sabrina","Coronado-Rivera, James (Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí); Valle, Marianela Solís-Del (Universidad de Costa Rica); Amador-Vargas, Sabrina (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute)",,"Coronado-Rivera, James (Autonomous University of Chiriqui); Valle, Marianela Solís-Del (University of Costa Rica); Amador-Vargas, Sabrina (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute)",6,3,,1.45,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/rbt/article/download/38505/41555,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134449588,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

Eleven factors including nutrient concentration, vinasse dilution (%v/v), inoculum volume, carbon to nitrogen ratio and initial pH, were investigated for their effects on laccase activity applying the Plackett-Burman screening design. The selected factors were optimized using a central composite design, and then evaluated on a vinasse biotreatment experiment. The factors that contributed the most to the enzymatic activity were the concentrations of MgSO4∙7H2O (A), FeSO4∙7H2O (B) and CuSO4∙5H2O (C), alongside initial pH.

Implicit measures of public expenditure distribution are also included. The study is based on agricultural and demographic census reports, government budgets, and other data sources. The results indicate that Panama's income is rather poorly distributed among both regions and families. The Gini coefficient varies from .51 to .69 between provinces and sectors.

The small, superficial, soft-textured yellow perithecia develop directly on the surface of the necrotic plant tissue. The unitunicate asci are filled with hyaline, long-fusiform, typically 6–12-septate ascospores that disarticulate into secondary part-ascospores that later produce tertiary spores. This undescribed fungus could not be cultured, nor was an asexual state observed. Morphological characteristics are inconsistent with any existing generic concept, but suggest a close phylogenetic relationship with species of Hypocreales. This was confirmed by molecular phylogenetic analysis of nrLSU rDNA sequences. While host relationship and disarticulation of ascospores suggest an affinity between this fungus and species of Clavicipitaceae, its colonization of necrotic tissue of a living host, lack of stromata, non-thickened apices of the asci, and long-fusiform (not filiform) ascospores suggest otherwise. Furthermore, this fungus differs morphologically from species in Bionectriaceae and Nectriaceae in its disarticulating long-fusiform ascospores, part-ascospores producing tertiary spores, and occurrence on living grasses. Our phylogenetic analysis of combined ITS, nrLSU, and TEF1 sequences yielded evidence for placement of the new species within the Hypocreales, close to Bionectriaceae and Nectriaceae. However, our analysis did not specifically clarify and support the species’ membership within either family. This fungus is described as Microchrysosphaera graminicola, a new genus and species belonging to the Hypocreales, incertae sedis.","The authors thank V. Araúz, G. Avendaño, A. Hertz, T. Hofmann, A.

A. callista attaches to the host with appressoria, invades the epidermal cell wall and forms an apoplastic complex cisternal net, presumably for nutrient uptake from its host. This unique structure, called an interaction apparatus (Ia), consists of cisternae surrounded by a membrane continuous with the fungal cytoplasmic membrane. Subsequently the apoplastic trunk of the Ia extends into the host epidermal cell wall and contacts the host cytoplasmic membrane. Electron-opaque material, probably of fungal origin appears at the host cytoplasmic membrane. Finally these electron-opaque deposits are encased by host material.

Within this family, species of the largest genus Kordyana develop balls of basidia on top of stomatal openings. Basidial cells originate from fungal stroma filling substomatal chambers. Species of Kordyana typically infect species of Commelinaceae. During fieldwork in the neotropics, fungi morphologically similar to Kordyana spp. were found on Goeppertia spp. (syn. Calathea spp., Marantaceae), namely on G. panamensis in Panama and on G. propinqua in Bolivia. These specimens are proposed as representatives of a genus new to science, Marantokordyana, based on the distinct host family and molecular sequence data of ITS and LSU rDNA regions. The specimens on the two host species represent two species new to science, M. oberwinkleriana on G. panamensis and M. boliviana on G. propinqua. They differ by the size and shape of their basidia, molecular sequence data of ITS and LSU rDNA regions, and host plant species. In the past, the understanding of Brachybasidiaceae at order and family level was significantly improved by investigation realized by Franz Oberwinkler and his collaborators at the University of Tübingen, Germany. On species level, however, our knowledge is still very poor due to incomplete species descriptions of several existing names in literature, scarceness of specimens, as well as sequence data lacking for many taxa and for further barcode regions. Especially species of Kordyana and species of Dicellomyces are in need of revision.Graphical Abstract","The specimens of Brachybasidiaceae in Panama were collected with friendly support by Nivardo Avila, Orlando Cáceres, Raiza Duarte, Anika Krohn, Ralph Mangelsdorff, and Martin U.

1017,pub.1134973482,10.3390/d13020049,,,Vascular Epiphyte Assemblages on Isolated Trees along an Elevational Gradient in Southwest Panama,"Ongoing destruction of tropical forests makes isolated pasture trees potentially important for the persistence of original forest dwellers such as many vascular epiphytes. We studied epiphyte assemblages on 100 isolated trees at ten pasture sites in southwest Panama along an elevational gradient ranging from 140 to 1240 m a.s.l. We analysed epiphyte species composition (richness, similarity) and registered climate and host trait variables of potential influence on their occurrence. We found a total of 5876 epiphyte individuals belonging to 148 species. Epiphyte abundance, species richness and diversity all varied about 4-fold among the 10 sites, with a high similarity of epiphyte assemblages among sites. Two sites at 870 and 1050 m a.s.l. did not fit into the overall elevational trend of increased abundance, species richness and diversity. However, all three measures were significantly correlated with humidity as the independent variable. This highlights that a gradient in humidity, and not elevation as such, is responsible for the typical elevational changes in epiphyte assemblages, so that special local conditions may lead to deviations from expected patterns. Our documentation of current elevational diversity patterns also provides a baseline for the study of long-term changes in epiphyte assemblages in anthropogenically modified landscapes.","We are grateful to Helena Einzmann, Katrin Wagner (both Oldenburg) and Iris Fossatti (Panama) for their help in field work, to the pasture owners of the study areas, specialists in taxonomic determination, Zabdy Samudio, Zuleika Serracín, Rodolfo Flores (UCH) and other collaborators in this investigation.

About 2670 species, 10% of all orchids known have been recorded there. Within this region, most of the species are concentrated in the southernmost countries. Costa Rica with 1598 species (or 0.030 spp/km2) and Panama with 1397 species (0.018 spp/km2) stand at the top of endemic species list of all Mesoamerica, with 35.37% and 28.52%, respectively. These figures, however, are misleading, as political boundaries do not have any relationship to orchid diversity. If we ignore the political frontier, there is a common biogeographic area. However, if we put the border back, the numbers in terms of scientific production and research change dramatically. Costa Rica has increased the knowledge of its orchid flora through the establishment of a successful research system, whereas Panama has lacked a similar process. To address this problem, the Lankester Botanical Garden at the Universidad de Costa Rica and the Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí, Panama, established a new research center focused on the study of orchids.

They are frequently overgrown and parasitized by other fungi, known as hyperparasites. During the last few years, species of hyperparasitic fungi on Meliolales have been collected in Benin and Panama. A new species of Paranectria and seven new reports of hyperparasites of different systematic groups are presented here with detailed descriptions and illustrations, together with new data concerning fungal hosts and host plants. The new species is called Paranectria longiappendiculata, characterized by exceptionally long appendages carried by the ascospores. New records for Benin and Panama are Calloriopsis herpotricha, Dimerosporiella cephalosporii, Isthmospora glabra, Isthmospora trichophila, Malacaria meliolicola, Paranectriella hemileiae, and Paranectriella minuta. Calloriopsis herpotricha is recorded for Africa and D. cephalosporii and P. hemileiae for America for the first time, suggesting an apparently pantropical distribution. Findings show a blatant lack of investigation on hyperparasitic fungi in the tropics. The phylogenetic positions of three of these newly reported species, C. herpotricha, D. cephalosporii, and P. minuta, are shown based on the analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), large subunit (LSU), and small subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences. These sequences were generated in the context of the present study for the first time.","We are grateful to the University of Parakou and the University of Abomey-Calavi, Benin, for the support and facilities made available for this study.

Molecular phylogenetic analyses using nuclear ribosomal DNA sequence data of the large subunit and the internal transcribed spacer region together with a fragment of the -tubulin gene suggest that the fungus belongs to the Dothideomycetes (Ascomycota) where it groups with members of the family Tetraplosphaeriaceae in Pleosporales. Morphologically, this placement is further supported by the presence of an internal hyphal structure found within the conidia of the Panamanian collection and an isotype specimen of the fungus similar to species of closely related genera within Tetraplosphaeriaceae, e.g., Quadricrura and Polyplosphaeria. The putative phylogenetic position of the morphologically similar Piricaudilium lobatum in Tetraplosphaeriaceae is proposed based on examination of its type specimen.","We are grateful to Markta andov (PRM) and the curator of IMI for the loan of herbarium specimens in their care and Anita Tiller (MERCA) for hosting loans to G.D. at her institution.

Two general mycological forays including most major groups of fungi were carried out in this area for the first time. During 3 days mostly in secondary vegetation and 2 days in pristine forest, about 104 specimens of macro- and microfungi were collected, of which 85 were identified as 76 species of which all but one were new records for the Darién Province. As a result, knowledge on fungal taxa in that region has risen from 19 to 94, i.e. by a factor of five. Although common and easily-spotted species were preferred during collection, 16 (more than 20%) of the species identified were new for Panama, notably two species of Agaricales, Hygroaster nodulisporus and Leucopaxillus gracillimus, and four microfungi on plants, Cercosporella leucaenae, Coccomyces delta, Meliola bixae, and Stigmina anacardii. The records of the species are presented together with specimen data, references, and photos of selected species. As shown by this study, fungi in tropical Panama are highly diverse, mostly unknown, and further mycological field work is urgently needed because habitats are destroyed and fungi specific to them are lost forever.","During the field work in the Darién Province, we were helped by A.

Therefore, within the framework of the research titled ""The Nine Languages of Architecture,"" a characterization is provided for various languages that constitute architecture. This document integrates semiotic language not as a capricious or vain act; on the contrary, it seeks to recognize semiotics beyond a concept and the simplicity of its meaning (which is by no means simple). This recognition infuses a profound dogma of its entire logic, use, and development within the education of future architects, particularly when aiming for its integration into everyday professional life. Additionally, when exploring authors and thinkers on semiotics in architecture, an immersion is evident among professionals from other disciplines, presenting extensive knowledge. This impact influences researchers involved in this orthodox theme in the foundation of architecture. The methodology of this essay stems from a central investigation titled ""The Nine Languages of Architecture,"" defining a qualitative-descriptive approach that involves collecting and analyzing non-numerical data to explore meanings and interpretations.

In Central America, however, information about the species of this genus is sparse, despite the generally high biodiversity in this region. Recently, 124 specimens of Entoloma were collected in Panama, Chiriquí Province. In the present publication, the morphology of 20 species represented by more than one specimen is described and depicted with photographs, line drawings, and scanning electron micrographs. Molecular phylograms based on ITS or concatenated ITS and partial nc LSU rDNA sequences are provided. The taxonomic status of these species is evaluated and 17 species of Entoloma are described as new to science. Only one species could be assigned to an already known species, viz. Entoloma belouvense. Nolanea albertinae, described from Brazil, appeared similar and is combined in E. belouvense on varietal level. The identifications of two further species are uncertain. At least 30 other species, including potentially new species, cannot formally be described due to insufficient material. A preliminary key to the species of the genus Entoloma in Panama is provided. The spatial shape of the polyhedroid basidiospores of Entoloma spp. is discussed based on literature and the micrographs generated for the present study. Our re-evaluations indicate that the type of polyhedroid basidiospore and the structure of its base are not reliable as diagnostic characters for the delimitation of subgenera in Entoloma.","We thank Hermine Lotz-Winter and Felix Hampe for invaluable support.

992,pub.1092536236,10.1007/s11557-017-1353-6,,,Contribution to the phylogeny and a new species of Coccodiella (Phyllachorales),"Coccodiella is a genus of plant-parasitic species in the family Phyllachoraceae (Phyllachorales, Ascomycota), i.e., tropical tar spot fungi. Members of the genus Coccodiella are tropical in distribution and are host-specific, growing on plant species belonging to nine host plant families. Most of the known species occur on various genera and species of the Melastomataceae in tropical America. In this study, we describe the new species C. calatheae from Panama, growing on Calathea crotalifera (Marantaceae). We obtained ITS, nrLSU, and nrSSU sequence data from this new species and from other freshly collected specimens of five species of Coccodiella on members of Melastomataceae from Ecuador and Panama. Phylogenetic analyses allowed us to confirm the placement of Coccodiella within Phyllachoraceae, as well as the monophyly of the genus. The phylogeny of representative species within the family Phyllachoraceae, including Coccodiella spp., graminicolous species of Phyllachora and taxa with erumpent to superficial stroma from several host families, suggests that the genus Phyllachora might be polyphyletic. Furthermore, tar spot fungi with superficial or erumpent perithecia seem to be restricted to the family Phyllachoraceae, independently of the host plant. We also discuss the biodiversity and host-plant patterns of species of Coccodiella worldwide.","We thank Daniel Cáceres, Orlando Cáceres and Darío Cruz for their help during the fieldwork.

Agaricales fungi showed maximum species richness at the beginning of rainy seasons, probably due to the important litter accumulation during the dry season and the increase in humidity favoring fungal growth. Species richness declined during the wet season possibly due to torrential rains, moulds, and decreasing availability of nutrients. Occurrence of foliar pathogenic microfungi correlated negatively with flushing of new leaves at the beginning of the rainy season. Their incidence increased during the wet season and remained high during the dry season. Synchronization of leaf shedding in most tree species significantly reduced the yearly incidence of foliar pathogenic fungi causing an annual turn-over of fungal pathogens that probably contributes to maintain a high diversity of plant pathogenic species.","The authors thank collaborators during fieldwork, especially Araúz, Caballero, Castillo, Espinosa, Kirschner, de Rincón, and Saldaña.

Habitat use and spatial preferences of whales during their reproductive season must be addressed to effectively conserve this species. Aims This study aims to determine spatial segregation depending on humpback whale group composition (groups that included mother–calf dyads versus adult-only groups). Methods Spatial aggregation was assessed using sightings per unit of effort from June to October, 2010–2019. The group preferences were analysed as a function of water depth and distance from the coast, and habitat use was characterised using behavioural data. Key results Our SPUE analysis showed important locations used by humpback whales. The mother–calf groups were present in waters <80 m deep, and their main behaviour was resting (nursing and social). Adult-only groups were in the deeper waters, and the main behaviours were social breaching and travelling. Spatial preferences and behaviour data allowed the identification of critical nursing areas near potential mating grounds. Conclusions and implications Our study has highlighted the need for inshore habitat protection, and these habitat-use patterns should be considered when designing effective conservation and management strategies for marine spatial planning.","We thank the Posgrado en Ciencias del Mar y Limnología, UNAM and the National Council on Science and Technology (CONACyT: number 790305) for a scholarship to Lili Pelayo-González.

It is estimated that half of the cases are due to iron deficiency. Consequences of iron deficiency anaemia during childhood include growth retardation, reduced school achievement, impaired motor and cognitive development, and increased morbidity and mortality. The provision of daily iron supplements is a widely used strategy for improving iron status in children but its effectiveness has been limited due to its side effects, which can include nausea, constipation or staining of the teeth. As a consequence, intermittent iron supplementation (one, two or three times a week on non-consecutive days) has been proposed as an effective and safer alternative to daily supplementation.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of intermittent iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals, on nutritional and developmental outcomes in children from birth to 12 years of age compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases on 24 May 2011: CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 2, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 20), CINAHL (1937 to current), POPLINE (all available years) and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). On 29 June 2011 we searched all available years in the following databases: SCIELO, LILACS, IBECS and IMBIOMED. We also contacted relevant organisations (on 3 July 2011) to identify ongoing and unpublished studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were children under the age of 12 years at the time of intervention with no specific health problems. The intervention assessed was intermittent iron supplementation compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 33 trials, involving 13,114 children (˜49% females) from 20 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The methodological quality of the trials was mixed.Nineteen trials evaluated intermittent iron supplementation versus no intervention or a placebo and 21 studies evaluated intermittent versus daily iron supplementation. Some of these trials contributed data to both comparisons. Iron alone was provided in most of the trials.Fifteen studies included children younger than 60 months; 11 trials included children 60 months and older, and seven studies included children in both age categories. One trial included exclusively females. Seven trials included only anaemic children; three studies assessed only non-anaemic children, and in the rest the baseline prevalence of anaemia ranged from 15% to 90%.In comparison with receiving no intervention or a placebo, children receiving iron supplements intermittently have a lower risk of anaemia (average risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.72, ten studies) and iron deficiency (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.91, three studies) and have higher haemoglobin (mean difference (MD) 5.20 g/L, 95% CI 2.51 to 7.88, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD 14.17 µg/L, 95% CI 3.53 to 24.81, five studies).Intermittent supplementation was as effective as daily supplementation in improving haemoglobin (MD -0.60 g/L, 95% CI -1.54 to 0.35, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD -4.19 µg/L, 95% CI -9.42 to 1.05, 10 studies), but increased the risk of anaemia in comparison with daily iron supplementation (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to1.47, six studies). Data on adherence were scarce and it tended to be higher among those children receiving intermittent supplementation, although this result was not statistically significant.We did not identify any differential effect of the type of intermittent supplementation regimen (one, two or three times a week), the total weekly dose of elemental iron, the nutrient composition, whether recipients were male or female or the length of the intervention.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent iron supplementation is efficacious to improve haemoglobin concentrations and reduce the risk of having anaemia or iron deficiency in children younger than 12 years of age when compared with a placebo or no intervention, but it is less effective than daily supplementation to prevent or control anaemia. Intermittent supplementation may be a viable public health intervention in settings where daily supplementation has failed or has not been implemented. Information on mortality, morbidity, developmental outcomes and side effects, however, is still lacking.","Luz Maria De‐Regil ‐ none known. Maria Elena D Jefferds ‐ none known.

After 3000 BC, the focus shifts to the area south of the Mesoamerica know as Lower Central America (Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and northeastern Honduras). The earliest evidence of human occupation in Central America yet recovered are those of the Paleoindian Clovis populations who entered the region around 11 000 BC when the climate was significantly cooler (by 5–7°C) and drier (by 30–40%) than at present. The Archaic (c. 10000–6000BC) hunter-gatherers were more numerous than their predecessors and, over time, incorporated increasing amounts of plant foods in their diet. Microfossil remains (pollen, phytoliths, and starch grains) of several domesticates including maize, squash, manioc, and arrowroot have been recovered from localities in Panama dating between 8000 and 6000BC. Large scale forest clearing for swidden agriculture was widespread throughout CA by 2000BC and as early as 6000BC in central Panama. The establishment of permanent settlements by 2000BC in parts of CA quickly led to the development of chiefdoms and ancient states in northern CA. In southern CA, the widespread appearance of permanent agricultural villages in the 1st millennium BC was accompanied by craft specialization, well-made ceramics, luxury goods of shell and semi-precious stone, differential treatment of the dead and regular intra- and inter-regional exchange. Full-blown chiefdoms first appeared in the 1st millennium AD in many different areas within Lower CA. Chiefly centers were variously marked by specialized residences for chiefs and other elites often built on raised platforms, monumental stone statuary, paved plazas and causeways, and luxury items of gold, semi-precious stone, ivory and bone, among other materials. Many of these luxury items found their way into elite tombs found in special cemeteries. At contact, Lower CA contained several culturally distinct subregions, each populated by autonomous chiefdoms and tribes oftentimes speaking mutually unintelligible languages.",,,,Encyclopedia of Archaeology,,,2008,2008,,2008,,Journal of Archaeological Research1322005,192-209,Closed,Chapter,"Ranere, Anthony","Ranere, Anthony (Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA)",,"Ranere, Anthony (Temple University)",3,1,,1.44,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031896863,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society; 4401 Anthropology",2 Zero Hunger

The Kuna and Guaymí People and the Formation of the Panamanian State,"In this chapter we survey the diverse political and ideological strategies put forth by the state and elites in order to take over areas of the ‘national territory’ thought of as ‘empty’ and ‘wild’, tear apart ethno-territories and cultural universes, and manage indigenous people and their resources under the veil of a consolidating a ‘national state’. We examine the experiences in the eastern and western frontiers of Panama during its transition from the Colombian period into republican life after 1903. Each case study illustrates the social construction of the indigenous societies (Kuna and Guaymí) targeted by these strategies. We consider that although the colonial enterprise was one, each territory strongly determined the specific modes of state encroachment, construction of the cultural other, and the discourses deployed to bring these social bodies within the national project. The documental corpus used in our study comprises press articles, official documents, and the writings of intellectuals and Catholic missionaries. In the eastern frontier the role of Catholic missions was key, as they were tasked with converting the indigenous population into ‘citizens’ useful to the homeland; to culturally ‘de-indianize’ (desindianizar) their ways of life and settlement; to wield political and economic power over the lands bordering Colombia; and to re-signify the ethnic territory. In the western frontier de-indianization must be understood differently, as it involved many central-western villages administratively losing the category of ‘indigenous’, giving way to the emergence and consolidation of a new socio-racial category, which not only reaffirmed the low-class status of the indigenous, but also obliterated any recognisable historical roots of prior categories.",,,The Latin American Studies Book Series,Territorialising Space in Latin America,"Michael K.

The generic limits of Sechium continue to be controversial. A phenetic analysis of the species of Sechium and its allies in subtribe Sicyinae , using both palynological and macromorphological characters, was carried out. The results of the analysis basically support the taxonomic circumscription of this genus proposed by Jeffrey (1978). Both cluster and ordination analyses showed that all the species recognized by Jeffrey as pertaining to the genus Sechium , as well as others more recently described, form a well defined group constituted by 11 species and clearly separated from other taxa in the subtribe Sicyinae. The observed clustering within Sechium does not correspond to the two sections of the genus recognized by Jeffrey.

964,pub.1067853765,10.15517/lank.v14i3.17958,,,An updated checklist of the Orchidaceae of Panama,"The Orchidaceae is one of the most diverse vascular plant families in the Neotropics and the most diverse in Panama. The number of species is triple that of other well-represented families of angiosperms such as Rubiaceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Despite its importance in terms of diversity, the latest checklist was published ten years ago and the latest in-depth taxonomic treatments were published in 1949 and 1993. The accumulation of information over the years and the need to update the nomenclature and to clarify taxonomic concepts made necessary the publication of an up-dated checklist of the Orchidaceae of Panama. This checklist was completed by studying specimens strictly collected in Panama and vouchered in herbaria. Species are presented alphabetically with their synonyms and herbarium vouchers. The data were analyzed to explain the patterns of geographic distribution, most diverse taxa, endemism, exotic species and relationships with other nearby floras. The checklist contains 1365 species (including two natural hybrids and three subspecies) in four subfamilies, 16 tribes, 27 subtribes and 187 genera. Four exotic species were recorded. A total of 296 (21.7%) species are endemic. Epidendroideae is the most diverse group housing more than 90% of species. The most diverse subtribes are Pleurothallidinae (30 genera, 405 spp.), Laeliinae (16 genera, 292 spp.), Oncidiinae (29 genera, 157 spp.) and Maxillariinae (18 genera, 132 spp.). The most diverse genera are: Epidendrum (206 spp.), Stelis (88 spp.), Lepanthes (66 spp.) and Pleurothallis (54 spp.). Nomenclatural changes are proposed in Maxillariella , Pleurothallis , Specklinia , Stelis and Trichocentrum . Many areas remain unexplored for orchids, and we estimate that much work remains to complete a floristic treatment that reveals more realistic data on the orchid flora that Panama harbors.

In the present study, prediction models were developed with Fourier transformed near infrared ( FT‐NIR ) spectroscopy and multivariate analysis for the cellulose crystallinity index ( CrI ), saccharification and ethanol yield, and glucan, hemicellulose and lignin content. Prediction models were generated using Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus radiata samples from different pretreatments such as bio pretreatment, kraft process, steam explosion, organosolv and biorganosolv process.    RESULTS  The calibration models obtained by partial least‐squares ( PLS ), presented high coefficients of calibration and validation determination. The predictive ability of the calibration models developed was evaluated in a set of external samples. The properties were predicted with a prediction error ( RMSEP ) of 0.02, 1.4 g L −1 , 2.0%, 0.9%, 1.0% and 1.9% for CrI , ethanol yield, saccharification, lignin, hemicellulose and glucan content, respectively.    CONCLUSION  These results suggest that it is possible to construct models for these properties with a database involving pulps from different pretreatments. NIR spectroscopy predictions provide useful and economic tools for rapid analysis of the large number of samples required in the assessment of bioethanol production processes. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry",Financial support from SENACYT as a member of Panama Research National System and FONDECYT‐Chile is gratefully acknowledged.,,Journal of Chemical Technology & Biotechnology,,,,2014-06-26,2014,2014-06-26,2015-07,90,7,1281-1289,Closed,Article,"Monrroy, Mariel; Garcia, José Renán; Troncoso, Eduardo; Freer, Juanita","Monrroy, Mariel (Centro de Investigación en Bioquímica y Química Aplicada, Chiriquí, Panamá; Departamento de Química, Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí, Panamá); Garcia, José Renán (Centro de Investigación en Bioquímica y Química Aplicada, Chiriquí, Panamá; Departamento de Química, Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí, Panamá); Troncoso, Eduardo (Renewable Resources Laboratory, Biotechnology Center, Concepción, Chile); Freer, Juanita (Renewable Resources Laboratory, Biotechnology Center, Concepción, Chile; Faculty of Chemical Sciences, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile)","Monrroy, Mariel (Centro de Investigación en Bioquímica y Química Aplicada, Chiriquí, Panamá; Autonomous University of Chiriqui)","Monrroy, Mariel (Centro de Investigación en Bioquímica y Química Aplicada, Chiriquí, Panamá; Autonomous University of Chiriqui); Garcia, José Renán (Centro de Investigación en Bioquímica y Química Aplicada, Chiriquí, Panamá; Autonomous University of Chiriqui); Troncoso, Eduardo (Renewable Resources Laboratory, Biotechnology Center, Concepción, Chile); Freer, Juanita (Renewable Resources Laboratory, Biotechnology Center, Concepción, Chile; University of Concepción)",11,1,,0.86,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018589947,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology,

Tropical montane forests support a high abundance and diversity of bryophytes and lichens on different substrates. However, quantitative information about how their biomass and water-holding capacity change with elevation is scarce. The current project assessed variation in the biomass and water-holding capacity of bryophytes and lichens on Baru Volcano, Panama. Methods. On the western slope, the bryophyte and lichen layer was collected from 600 cm2 plots on six substrate types with four replications at eight elevations along a gradient from 1900 to 3300 m a.s.l. We recorded the thickness, water-holding capacity and biomass of all samples, as well as environmental parameters. Key results. At lower elevations substrates had a similar biomass and water-holding capacity per area, but with increasing elevation terricolous substrates showed the strongest increase (highest values at 3100 m). These patterns are associated with climatic variation along the gradient. At the highest elevations, the forest was of low stature and more light reached the forest floor. Also at these high elevations fog provides a daily wetting of the bryophytes and lichens. At lower elevations the water supply is increasingly in the form of rain, which is less frequent than the fog. Conclusions. The apparent strong coupling of biomass variations to precipitation regimes implies a high sensitivity of the bryophytes and lichens to climatic warming and changes in the cloud base elevation. Furthermore our data suggest that the importance of bryophytes and lichens for regulating ecosystem water fluxes increases with elevation, which underlines the necessity to conserve intact montane forests.","The first author thanks the Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Panamá (SENACYT) and the Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí (UNACHI) for providing financial support.

Evaluation of Trichoptera (Insecta) from Omar Torrijos Herrera General Division National Park,"The objective of this study was a preliminary evaluation of the adult Trichoptera (Insecta) fauna of Omar Torrijos Herrera General Division National Park, comparing collection methods and local/regional species affinities. Employing both Malaise traps and UV light traps, adult caddisflies were collected in four streams (two each in the Caribbean and Pacific drainages). In recent publications, 11 new species were described and four first country records published for this study. Seventy-two taxa were identified from all samples, with two species yet to be described. We found multiple collection methods were required to adequately estimate species richness. The Chao2 estimator of potential species richness indicated a minimum of 118 species, and even more species could be expected if prolonged sampling occurred monthly in all park streams. The identification and addition of 15 new taxa to Panama’s Trichoptera fauna from such a small area and sampling effort is both remarkable and encouraging.","We are grateful to the Panamanian Ministry of Environment, which, through the Sustainable Production System and Biodiversity Conservation Project (PSPSCB), financed the collections in PNGDOTH from the World Bank grant and which provided collection permits and other support.

Although distribution patterns have been described, little emphasis has been placed on comparing patterns among substrates (e.g., terrestrial, epiphytic). Understanding these patterns is important, because they determine not only the pool of genetic resources, but also the functioning of these forest ecosystems. Therefore, we studied how bryophyte species diversity changes with elevation, how elevational patterns differ between substrate types, and how elevational trends relate to environmental drivers.   Location Baru volcano, Panama.   Methods  At each of eight elevations, between 1900 and 3300 m, bryophytes were collected in 600‐cm 2 plots from six substrate types with four replicates. Species cover was registered as a measure of relative abundance. Species richness and community structure were determined and related to elevation, substrate types, and environmental drivers at three scales (plots, sets of four replicate plots per substrate per elevation, and all plots at each elevation).    Results Bryophyte species richness decreased towards higher elevations, at all three scales and on all substrates except bryophytes on soil, for which, at the plot scale, richness peaked at higher elevations than on the other substrates. Relative humidity explained richness slightly better than elevation. Communities at the lowest elevations had the most uneven compositions, due to the presence of many small species with low abundance.   Conclusions In studies on the spatial distribution of bryophyte diversity, it is essential to consider different substrates and spatial scales separately. If substrates differ in their elevational species richness patterns, climate and land‐use change may affect bryophyte diversity patterns not only directly, but also indirectly via changes in substrate availability. Therefore, a better understanding of the spatial variation in bryophyte diversity in mountains is essential to elucidate the effects of environmental change on this important group of plants and their implications for ecosystem functioning.","The first author would like to thank Dario and Ines Quiroz, Calixto Rodriguez Quiel, Iris Fossatti and Nikelly Guerra for their excellent companionship and assistance during the fieldwork.

The indigenous people of P anama continue to face serious challenges. Our research examines the N gäbe B uglé because they are the largest and most politically active indigenous groups in P anama. Almost half of the indigenous people live on semiautonomous reservations (comarcas). Although some may hail Panama's creation of comarcas as a milestone for indigenous rights, norms are only partially effective in this case. The influence of key stakeholders can influence how norms are carried out. In Panama, the government alternates between attempting to constrain civil society and giving in to demands when the protests can no longer be ignored. The P anamanian government has shown little respect for indigenous rights in its battle over natural resources located on the comarcas; moreover, the indigenous do not enjoy the same rights and privileges as those P anamanians living outside of the comarcas.

Los indígenas de P anamá siguen enfrentándose a graves desafíos. Nuestra investigación examina la comarca N gäbe B uglé, ya que en esta se encuentran los grupos indígenas más grandes y más activos políticamente en P anamá. Casi la mitad de los indígenas viven en las reservas semi‐autónomas (comarcas). Aunque algunos pueden aclamar la creación de comarcas de Panamá como un hito para los derechos indígenas, las normas son solo parcialmente eficaces en este caso. La influencia de los actores clave puede afectar cómo se llevan a cabo las normas. En P anamá, el gobierno se encuentra entre el intento de restringir la sociedad civil y de ceder a las demandas cuando las protestas ya no pueden ser ignoradas.

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a network dynamic architecture including security policies and traffic monitoring decisions. In our approach, the intrusion and detection are performed by Suricata and the controller, automatically blocking attempted attacks using Openflow rules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through the use of five attack scenarios.

916,pub.1160020317,10.1007/s13225-023-00519-2,,,Phylogeny and taxonomy of Rhytisma-like species worldwide,"Rhytisma Fr. is the type genus of Rhytismataceae (Rhytismatales, Leotiomycetes, Ascomycota). Rhytisma-like species include members of Cryptomyces, Rhytisma and Vladracula. They are parasites on leaves of broadleaf trees and cause tar spot diseases. In this study, a phylogeny based on the large subunit of the ribosomal rRNA gene (nrLSU) and the mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU) is presented, including sequences of 39 newly collected specimens from East Asia, Europe, and temperate as well as tropical America. Based on analyses of morphology, phylogeny as well as host-specificity and diversification time estimates, the family Rhytismataceae sensu stricto is proposed, and eight genera are accepted in this narrow family, including four novel genera (Densorhytisma, Fanglania, Johnstoniella and Shiqia), the type genus Rhytisma, and the reinstated genera Lophodermina, Placuntium and Xyloma. Lophodermina clusters within the main Rhytisma clade in our analyses, but is divergent in morphological terms, not having large compound stromata. Thirty species are recognized, including seven novel species (Fanglania hubeiensis, F. parasitica, Johnstoniella yunnanensis, Rhytisma japonicum, Rh. taiwanense, Xyloma globosum, and X. shennongjiaense), fifteen new combinations (Densorhytisma anhuiense, D. huangshanense, F. concova, F. himalensis, F. ilicis-integrae, F. ilicis-latifoliae, F. ilicis-pedunculosae, J. lonicerae, Rh. annuliforme, Shiqia menziesii, S. yuexiensis, X. filamentosum, X. maximum, X. muelleri, and X. polare), one new name (J. xylostei), seven known species (Lophodermina melaleuca, Placuntium andromedae, Rhytisma acerinum, Rh. americanum, Rh. punctatum, X. salicinum, and X. umbonatum). In addition, seven immature specimens were studied but not assigned to existing species, herein referred to as Fanglania sp. 1, Johnstoniella sp. 1, Johnstoniella sp. 2, Placuntium sp. 1, Placuntium sp. 2, Rhytisma sp. 1, and Xyloma sp. 1. The systematic positions of Cryptomyces maximus, Cr. muelleri and Vladracula annuliformis are re-assigned based on phylogenetic analysis. One Rhytisma-like species from tropical America was segregated from Rhytismataceae s.str., thus a novel genus Neorhytisma was established to accommodate this species, with the one new combinations Neorhytisma panamense. The results of the molecular phylogenetic analysis indicate that Rhytisma-like species are host-specific at genus level. Apparently, Rhytisma-like species coevolved with their hosts, and Rhytisma-like species on Ericaceae seem to be in the process of host jumping. Morphological characteristics of ascomata are important for the delimitation of species and genera of Rhytisma-like species. This study provides a key to genera and species of recognized Rhytisma-like species worldwide.","We are grateful to Dr Masanori Kutsuna (Japan) for kindly providing herbarium specimens of Rhytisma spp. We also thank Tom Hsiang, Adolf Ceska, Oldriska Ceska (Canada) as well as Alicia Sanjur (Panama) for collecting specimens.

913,pub.1104648497,10.1111/maec.12497,,,Regional and species specific sexual reproductive patterns of three zooxanthellate scleractinian corals across the Eastern Tropical Pacific,"Abstract  Sexual reproduction of zooxanthellate scleractinian corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) is influenced by the interactive effects of regional and local oceanographic conditions, as well as a variety of other environmental factors. Differences in spatial and temporal gamete development and reproductive patterns of three widespread scleractinian corals of this region— Pocillopora damicornis (branching colony morphology, characterized as hermaphrodite broadcaster), Pavona gigantea (massive colonies, characterized as gonochoric broadcaster/sequential co‐sexually hermaphroditic) and Porites panamensis (encrusting colonies, characterized as gonochoric brooder)—were evaluated at local and regional scales across the ETP. This area extended from the Gulf of California (24°N) to the southern coast of Ecuador (–1°S), including offshore islands, using existing data pooled from prior studies. Predictive models were employed based on environmental variables: sea surface temperature, daylight hours, diffuse attenuation co‐efficient at 490 nm and photosynthetically active radiation. Datasets were extracted from satellite images ( https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov ) and analysed using WAM_STATIST ver. 6.33® software to obtain monthly average data from each site. The spatial (region, sub‐region and site) and seasonal (wet, dry) variation in reproductive activity (% colonies with gametes) differed among the three species; significant interactions were season × sub‐region for P. damicornis , season × site (sub‐region) for P. gigantea , and season × site for P. panamensis , for which sub‐region was not considered as a factor. The predictive models also suggest that gamete production/maturation of P. damicornis and P. gigantea is influenced by local differences in sea surface temperature and daylight hours. Porites panamensis was not correlated with any environmental variable examined. Variations in local and regional reproductive developmental patterns are likely an acclimatization response by each species imposed by the timing and duration of local stressor events. This analysis has provided insights into the diverse local and regional physical drivers that affect species responses and acclimatization in sexual reproduction across the ETP.","J.D.S.‐V. received support from doctoral fellowship CONACYT (National Councyl of Science and Technology) No. 262538.

905,pub.1130672230,10.1016/j.jaa.2020.101226,,,Intentional dental modification in Panamá: New support for a late introduction of African origin,"Intentional dental modification is a widespread practice in both ancient and modern populations. In Panama, the modern practice is restricted to the Ngäbe indigenous people inhabiting the western provinces. Several researchers have posited that Ngäbe dental modification evidences cultural transfer of African origin due to the absence of post-contact records of this practice in the region, and based on the chipping technique used to create a pointed tooth shape. In this paper, we collate bioarchaeological data from human remains recovered from pre-contact and early colonial period contexts in Panama to evaluate this hypothesis. The results of our study found no evidence for intentional dental modification among the pre-contact sample, but several instances of artificially modified incisor teeth among the early colonial sample. The latter pertained exclusively to individuals of African ancestry, and whose teeth had been chipped to points in the same manner as reported from Ngäbe communities. Isotope data revealed that one individual was a first-generation immigrant who likely originated from the African continent. Based on these results, as well as an exhaustive review of the ethnohistorical and modern ethnographic literature, the original hypothesis of a late introduction of African origin for the practice of dental shaping among the Ngäbe was upheld.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

A new conceptualization of Chayanov’s Theory of Peasant Economy is employed to understand ranchers’ perceptions of tree management in Panama. Chayanov’s theory proposes that the family farm is governed by a balance of decisions farmers make between the utility of producing one more item, with the drudgery of producing that item. Farm visits and interviews with 54 Panamanian farmers indicates that trees are actively maintained as part of the utility–drudgery balancing process. These findings suggest that rather than seeing cattle ranchers as perpetrators of deforestation, more research that considers the benefits and tradeoffs farmers confront with tree management could promote productive partnerships among parties invested in farmers’ livelihoods and forest conservation.","We are grateful to the farmers that kindly welcomed us into their farm and shared their experiences.

                    Examples of addiction problems that have been reported in growing populations are those related to sexual impulses and addictions. However, such studies have not been carried out in Latin America. The aim of this study was to characterize and identify possible associations of sexual addiction in medical students in Latin America.
                  
                  
                    Methods:
                    An analytical cross-sectional study was carried out among the university students of a medical school in 16 cities; students of medical schools were interviewed during the first semester of 2016. To define sexual addiction, the multi-cage cad-4 test was used, categorizing individuals as possibly or not a potential problem. Additionally, associations with several social and educational variables were obtained.
                  
                  
                    Results:
                    In our study, 6% (221) of the 3691 respondents exhibited a possible problem of sexual addiction; men had 95% more problems (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 21-214, p=0.006), for each year of age it increased by 9% (95%CI: 1-18%, p=0.034 ), those who had a partner were 67%  more likely to exhibit sexual addiction (95%CI: 1.34-2.08%, p <0.001) and those who professed a religion present 44% less frequency (95%CI: 20-60%, p: 0.001). When adjusted for marital status, having children, year of studies, and the university where the respondent studied were not associated.
                  
                  
                    Conclusion:
                    Although the percentage of students who had problems with sexual addiction is minimal, screening programs should be created to find students who suffer from these problems, to avoid the possible consequences that may arise.","The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.

892,pub.1141884814,10.1007/s10811-021-02605-x,,,Influence of irradiance on the growth and biochemical composition of Nitzschia aff. pellucida,"In this paper the influence of irradiance and the operation modes on biomass production and biochemical composition, especially the fatty acid profile, on the diatom Nitzschia aff. pellucida was studied. Experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions, but simulating those outdoors, at irradiances ranging from 100 to 1000 µmol photons m−2 s−1, both in batch and semi-continuous mode. The data show that the growth rate increased with irradiance, following a hyperbolic relationship with the average irradiance (Eav). However, at irradiances higher than 450 µmol photons m−2 s−1, photo-inhibition was observed, with Fv/Fm values notably decreasing at irradiances above 1000 µmol photons m−2 s−1. To take account of this phenomenon, a growth model is proposed that considers the saturation constant modification (Ek) as a function of available irradiance. The data indicate that N. aff. pellucida is better adapted to low irradiances, below 300 µmol photons m−2 s−1. Regarding the biochemical composition, the highest content of lipids (~ 20%) and carbohydrates (~ 40%) was achieved at high irradiances (≥ 450 µmol photons m−2 s−1), while the highest protein content (> 8%) was found at low irradiances (≤ 200 µmol photons m−2 s−1). Elevated amounts of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (> 60%) were measured at high irradiances, while the highest content of unsaturated fatty acids (USFA) (> 35%) was found at low irradiances. Eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n-3) (EPA) and arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6) (ARA) were only detected at 200 µmol m−2 s−1 but not at higher irradiances. The results confirm the effects of irradiance and the cultivation mode on the growth and biochemical composition of N. aff. pellucida.

Mobilization capacity and strategic bargaining in local ethnic conflicts in Latin America,"Since democratic liberalization, local ethnic conflicts have proliferated in Latin America—often triggered by decision-making on extractive or infrastructure projects on indigenous land. This article offers new insights on how to resolve these conflicts peacefully and particularly examines the effects of consultation and territorial autonomy rights for indigenous peoples. The proposed analytical framework refines actor-centered institutionalism with network-theoretical concepts to link the institutional level of rights with interaction-based and organization-centered factors whose effects have not yet been analyzed systematically. Empirical scrutiny builds on comparative process tracing of three exemplary conflicts: the decision-making process concerning a national park in Colombia (as an ideal case with prior consultations), the conflict over a hydroelectric dam in Panama (as a deviant case resulting in ethnic violence despite indigenous autonomy) and a mining project in Chile (as another deviant case leading to a peaceful agreement despite a least-likely setting without rights). For within-case analyses, network-analytic methods are used to examine access and bargaining mechanisms. One of the study’s results—which is of particular relevance for the scholarly discussion on multicultural legal renovations—is that regular channels of interaction of indigenous groups with public authorities foster peaceful interest intermediation. These can be created by consultation and autonomy rights but also by difference-blind decentralization reforms. The empirical analysis also shows how indigenous groups can accommodate to the bargaining logic of decision-making on their land; they do have relevant power resources at their disposal and can deploy them effectively.","The author would like to thank the interviewees for their time, interest, and contribution.

The ETP is a natural laboratory, a model for understanding the development of coral biotopes in a changing environment. We evaluate conservation strategies in seven countries in the ETP region (Peru was not included for apparent lack of coral habitats). A survey of current Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) highlights great variation in the number, scale and management approaches. Generally, MPAs with no-take areas are relatively uncommon, with multi-purpose areas favored. The Cabo Pulmo MPA in Baja California, Mexico demonstrates that when a local community is involved in the creation and enforcement measures of an MPA, conservation success can be achieved. Despite such apparent successes, inadequate and confusing legal practices have generally forestalled effective protection of coral ecosystems in the ETP. However, in several instances nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have assisted with planning, negotiation and stakeholder engagement. Nonetheless these findings underscore how the establishment of an MPA does not guarantee that conservation goals will be achieved. This calls for a new approach that incorporates contributions from ecological studies along with a high investment in capacity development and training to ensure that the goals of MPAs better complement effective fisheries and ecosystem management within and outside their borders.","We thank the editors of this book for inviting us to participate in this project.

Drawing on ethnohistoric and archaeological information, it is argued that native peoples along the Pacific Coast of Central America from El Salvador to the Nicoya Peninsula (Costa Rica) are best understood as part of the Mesoamerican periphery. The Central American peoples south of Nicoya formed both a chiefly world-system of their own and part of the Mesoamerican frontier by engaging in networks of trade and preciosity exchanges with the coastal Mesoamericans in Nicoya and Nicaragua. Support for this argument is based primarily on two “microhistoric” case studies of peoples located on both sides of the Mesoamerican/Lower Central America border, specifically the Chorotegans of the Masaya/Granada area of Nicaragua and the Chibchans of the Diquis/Buenos Aires area of Costa Rica. Archaeological information on sites in both areas and documentation from Spanish colonial sources that refer to native peoples in these areas strongly indicate that the Masaya/Granada peoples were active participants in the Mesoamerican regional network. In contrast, information from the Diquis/Buenos Aires area for this period reveals only weak Mesoamerican ties but strong relations with a Chibchan intersocietal network of chiefdoms.",,,Ancient Mesoamerica,,,,2006-07,2006,2007-03-19,2006-07,17,2,219-229,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Carmack, Robert M.; González, Silvia Salgado","Carmack, Robert M.

Traits were scored following the Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System on permanent teeth and analyzed by means of multivariate statistical techniques. At micro-regional level, the CR’s collections manifest morphological similarities between one another; however, Jicaro tends to slightly separate from the others despite its very close geographical proximity to La Cascabel. This is interpreted as due to the external influence of people who established at the site from Mesoamerica at the onset of the second millennium AD. On a macro-regional base, instead, the CR collections gather more closely to the samples from the Maya area rather than to the one from Panama and to the Muiscas from northern Colombia, despite they all belong to the Isthmo-Colombian, Chibchan-speaking area. This is interpreted as the result of strong ties with the Maya area, as highlighted by the archaeological record, and to the east–west genetic clinal distribution within the Isthmo-Colombian area that tends to set apart CR from Panama and Colombia, the latter being more likely related to the Andean area rather than to the Isthmo region. Larger samples are however necessary to have a clearer picture of the demic relationships in Prehispanic Central America.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Bat flies can in turn be parasitized by Laboulbeniales fungi, which are biotrophs of arthropods. This is a second level of parasitism, hyperparasitism, a severely understudied phenomenon. Four genera of Laboulbeniales are known to occur on bat flies, Arthrorhynchus on Nycteribiidae in the Eastern Hemisphere, Dimeromyces on Old World Streblidae, Gloeandromyces on New World Streblidae, and Nycteromyces on Streblidae in both hemispheres. In this chapter, we introduce the different partners of the tripartite interaction and discuss their species diversity, ecology, and patterns of specificity. We cover parasite prevalence of Laboulbeniales fungi on bat flies, climatic effects on parasitism of bat flies, and coevolutionary patterns. One of the most important questions in this tripartite system is whether habitat has an influence on parasitism of bat flies by Laboulbeniales fungi. We hypothesize that habitat disturbance causes parasite prevalence to increase, in line with the “dilution effect.” This can only be resolved based on large, non-biased datasets. To obtain these, we stress the importance of multitrophic field expeditions and international collaborations.","DH received support from the following sources: David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies (2015/2017 Summer and 2015 Term-Time Research Travel Grants), Harvard University Herbaria (2017 Fernald Fund), Mycological Society of America (2016 Graduate Fellowship, 2017 Robert W.

864,pub.1084248116,10.1177/1940082917698468,,,Species Richness and Biomass of Epiphytic Vegetation in a Tropical Montane Forest in Western Panama,"In tropical montane forests epiphytes represent a substantial proportion of biodiversity and green biomass, particularly where fog occurs almost daily. Epiphytes play important ecological roles in these ecosystems, for example, in forest hydrology and in amplifying arthropod biodiversity, but quantitative assessments of epiphytic biomass and species diversity are rare. Such data are important, however, for a better understanding on their ecological roles and as a baseline for detecting ecological change due to climate or land-use changes. In a tropical lower montane cloud forest (c. 1,150 m above sea level) in Panama, we identified and weighed all epiphytic matter, which includes vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens, and dead organic matter from the trunks of 22 trees varying in diameters at breast height and 28 canopy branches. Additionally, we collected epiphytic matter in the understory in 22 plots of 2 × 2 m. A total of 155 species of vascular epiphytes, hemiepiphytes, and nomadic vines were found. Orchidaceae were by far the most species-rich family, followed by Araceae and Bromeliaceae. The vertical distribution of these species in the forest showed species-specific vertical preferences, but species numbers varied little in undergrowth, trunks, and tree crowns. Epiphytic matter was positively related to tree size, and we used tree-size data inventory data from a nearby 1-ha plot to extrapolate our findings to the plot level. The resulting estimate of 16,439 kg ha−1 for total epiphytic matter and 6,214 kg ha−1 for living plants, the latter representing about 2% of aboveground forest biomass.","The authors thank Dr. Jim Dalling and Katherine Heineman, Urbana, Illinois, for generously sharing tree plot data.

Ophidion erectilabrum sp. nov. is morphologically similar to O. alphonsianum, but the new species is recognized by the orbicular leaves (vs. elliptic), the erect inflorescence, longer than the leaves (vs. descending, shorter than the leaves), and the abruptly upward curved epichile (vs. flat). Because of the different proposals in the circumscription of Phloeophila s.l., we performed a new phylogenetic analysis to assess the most appropriate genus to place the new species, and discuss the phylogenetic position of Luerella, Ophidion, and Phloeophila based on all currently available data from nrITS and matK and recent studies using high-throughput sequencing. Although the three genera are supported as monophyletic groups, we recovered unresolved relationships and discordant topologies among them using only these two molecular markers. Therefore, we describe this species in Ophidion because of the morphological differences between Luerella and Phloeophila and because the grouping of Phloeophila s.l. lacks diagnostic features, and is yet to be supported by molecular analysis.","This manuscript was made possible thanks to the Valle del Cauca government and Colciencias through the project BPIN.2017000100059 and the Councils Community of the upper and middle Dagua, Cordoba and San Cipriano rivers, Universidad del Valle Foundation, San Cipriano Foundation (FSC), and the Autonomous Corporation CVC.

A total of 118 species were recorded in the Neotropical-Caribbean region based on existing literature and results from fieldwork. About 74% of the species are restricted to the region and most of them show limited distributional areas as a consequence of environmental heterogeneity. Based on Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity, five areas of endemism were identified: (1) southern Florida, (2) southern Mexico-northern Central America, (3) Cuba, (4) Lesser Antilles, and (5) northern Venezuela-Aruba-Curacao-Trinidad. The conservation status of these areas was revised and lake ecosystems with endemic taxa were proposed to be included in environmental protection initiatives. Biogeographical analysis showed a strong differentiation between the ostracode faunas of the Neotropical-Caribbean region and the Neotropical-Neogen region. Few exchanges of species were attributed to ecological and geographical barriers such as volcanism and irregular orography. Faunal affinities within the Neotropical-Caribbean region indicated closer relationship between southern Mexico, southern Florida and the Antilles suggesting a common biogeographical history. Middle Central America and Chiapas-Guatemala highlands were discriminated as isolated regions.","We thank all colleagues and institutions involved in this work: the students team from the Instituto Tecnológico de Chetumal (Mexico): Christian Vera, León E.

One is Isthmoheros tuyrensis, which until now was presumed to be distributed in the Darien Province and the Bayano River basin. Information on distribution and ecology of I. tuyrensis is relatively scarce. In this investigation we report a new range extension for the species and provide additional morphological and ecological data. Fish were sampled using electrofishing and cast nets, in three river basins of the Panama District (Matasnillo, Juan Díaz, and Pacora) from August–September (rainy season) of 2020, February–March (dry season), and April (transition season) of 2021. Fish diversity, water quality, and physical parameters were gathered within the upper, middle, and lower portions of the three basins. This study focused on the localities where specimens of I. tuyrensis were found (i.e., Pacora river basin). The presence of the species in localities with significant anthropogenic threats results in a potential barrier for distribution, along with the possibility of extirpation due to heavy pollution – in particular from the rivers on the western side of Panama City. In addition, we note an increase in urban threat from the east of the city due to expanded development and agricultural activities. I. tuyrensis, the virtually unknown “Aveinte” in Spanish or the “Isthmian Hero”, is listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)’s Red List and inhabits some river basins lacking effective protection, being the only endemic fish species located in an urban basin in the Pacific of Mesoamerica. The information on distribution, morphology, and ecology provided here will contribute to a better understanding of the species’ biology and will aid the creation and implementation of management and conservation measures.",,,Journal of Threatened Taxa,,,,2023-02-26,2023,2023-02-26,,15,2,22611-22622,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dominici-Arosemena, Arturo; Angulo, Arturo; Osorio-Ugarte, Haydee; Ortega-Samaniego, Quiriatjaryn; Fraiz, Andres; Guerrel, Arminda; Arauz, Edgar; Montiel, Jennifer; Medina, Beatriz; Rodriguez-Arriati, Yehudi; Gonzalez, Yessenia; Pardo, Javier; Urriola, Karly; Ramos-Merchante, Adrian","Dominici-Arosemena, Arturo (Universidad Marítima Internacional de Panamá (UMIP), Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Apartado 0843-03561, Ciudad de Panamá, República de Panamá); Angulo, Arturo (Museo de Zoología, Centro de Investigación en Biodiversidad y Ecología Tropical (CIBET), Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR) 11501-2060, San Pedro de Montes de Oca, San José, Costa Rica); Osorio-Ugarte, Haydee (Universidad Tecnológica de Panamá (UTP)); Ortega-Samaniego, Quiriatjaryn (Instituto Universitario de Investigación de Ingeniería del Agua y Medio Ambiente Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, Camino de Vera S/N Valencia 46022 España); Fraiz, Andres (Wetlands International, Latinoamérica y el Caribe Apartado Postal 0819-03717, Ciudad de Panamá, República de Panamá); Guerrel, Arminda (Universidad Marítima Internacional de Panamá (UMIP), Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Apartado 0843-03561, Ciudad de Panamá, República de Panamá); Arauz, Edgar (Universidad de Panamá (UP).

This investigation adds a geographical approach to common pool resource (CPR) theory to examine and better understand the management structure and integrated conservation and development of a binational park. It considers two of Ostrom’s institutional arrangements for CPR success: (a) collective-choice arrangements and (b) multiple layers of governance. A qualitative case study approach with semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and participant observation is used. Results reveal the current management structure exhibits varying degrees of fortress conservation. Greater stakeholder involvement has been attempted; however, these measures differ greatly across the regions with some success achieved on the Pacific side of La Amistad, but less success on the Caribbean side. Variations occur primarily due to asymmetries in funding, personnel, strength and number of park-related associations, and tension over indigenous rights.",,The author received financial assistance through Huxley small grants: the Sustainability Fund and RSP.

Location  The Neotropical region from northern Mexico to northern Argentina, and the Nearctic and Andean regions.   Method  A total of 2205 records of 101 species were analysed, representing 95% of the species assigned to Bomarea . Localities were represented on maps and their individual tracks were drawn. Based on their comparison, generalized tracks were detected and mapped. Nodes were identified in the areas where different generalized tracks were superimposed.   Results  Five generalized tracks were recovered. One is located in the Eastern Central America and Western Panamanian Isthmus provinces (Caribbean subregion, Neotropical region), which was supported by three species of Central American distribution. The four remaining generalized tracks were located in South America, in the North Andean Paramo, Cauca and Puna biogeographical provinces. These tracks were supported by species of Bomarea with an Andean distribution. Biogeographical nodes were established in the Central Andean region of Colombia, central Ecuador and central Peru.   Main conclusions  The nodes obtained for Bomarea support a hybrid origin for the Andean region, which presents diverse components from both northern and southern South America. Likewise, the track recovered between Colombia and Ecuador includes Andean and Neotropical areas, providing further support for this hypothesis. The nodes obtained are coherent with vicariant elements evident for Bomarea. Species of three clades proposed for Bomarea are distributed in specific generalized tracks.","We are grateful to Mónica Ramírez, Malte Ebach, John Grehan, David Neil and one anonymous referee for useful comments on the manuscript.",,Journal of Biogeography,,,,2008-07-14,2008,2008-07-14,2008-07,35,7,1250-1257,Closed,Article,"Alzate, Fernando; Quijano‐Abril, Mario Alberto; Morrone, Juan J.","Alzate, Fernando (Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Instituto de Biología, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); Quijano‐Abril, Mario Alberto (Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Instituto de Biología, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); Morrone, Juan J.

In terms of biodiversity, the isthmus is considered one of the richest regions in the world. Orchidaceae is the most diverse plant family in the area, and the number of species is triple that of other well-represented angiosperm families such as Rubiaceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Though we are still far from knowing the exact number of orchid species occurring extant in both countries nowadays, at present the orchid flora reported for Costa Rica (1574 spp.) and Panama (1372 spp.) summarise together about 2010 species; which represents 6.5-8.0% of all orchid species on just about 1% of the Earth’s land surface. Pleurothallidinae and Laeliinae are the most species rich groups and contain the largest genera: Lepanthes, Pleurothallis, Stelis and Epidendrum . These groups significantly outnumber the other genera recorded in terms of species richness. Some factors explaining this regional taxonomic diversity of orchids are the natural land bridge uniting three of the 25 recognized hotspots worldwide (Mesoamerica, Choco/Darien/Western Ecuador and tropical Andes), the climatic influence of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and the recent lifting of the Cordillera de Talamanca and the formation of foothills of Majé, Darien and San Blas in Panama and western Colombia. Although these factors can explain the high diversity in general terms, detailed information is needed to understand species diversification as well as the evolution of the floristic composition. Updated floristic inventories (yielding a rate of 25 new species/year) and the study of biological mechanisms that have led to the evolutionary diversification of Lepanthes (one of the major groups of orchids) are the main ongoing research projects to elucidate the evolution of Orchidaceae in Costa Rica and Panama. Towards this end, we present some preliminary results of the research conducted in this direction including the integration of phylogenetics, pollination ecology, taxonomy and biogeography.",,,Lankesteriana,,,,2016-08-30,2016,2016-08-30,,16,2,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bogarín, Diego; Pupulin, Franco; Smets, Erik; Gravendeel, Barbara","Bogarín, Diego (Lankester Botanical Garden, University of Costa Rica, Cartago, Costa Rica); Pupulin, Franco (Lankester Botanical Garden, University of Costa Rica, Cartago, Costa Rica); Smets, Erik (Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands); Gravendeel, Barbara (Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands)",,"Bogarín, Diego (University of Costa Rica); Pupulin, Franco (University of Costa Rica); Smets, Erik (Leiden University); Gravendeel, Barbara (Leiden University)",7,2,,0.95,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/lankesteriana/article/download/26005/26285,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1067853796,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,14 Life Below Water

[Objective]: This study, aims to show the importance of conservation in the Centro Turistico Los Chocuacos (CTLC) reserve, which is a threatened area, and that conserves a forest, between secondary and primary, of approximately 30 years.  [Methodology]: In an area of 25 hectares (ha), a floristic inventory was performed by random walks along the forest edge, trails, river, waters springs, and areas not crossed by trails. The botanical specimens were collected in a reproductive state, which were botanized and deposited in the Herbarium Luis A. Fournier Origgi of the University of Costa Rica. [Results]: The CTLC reserve has a floristic wealth of 75 families, 219 genera and 266 species. The results yield important data, such as, a new record for Costa Rica, Eugenia veraguensis, and a species of the genus Aristolochia, that is currently being described as new specie for science.

836,pub.1158676888,10.21203/rs.3.rs-2711241/v1,,,The amphibian extinction crisis is still an emergency,"Anthropogenic biodiversity loss is extreme in amphibians. Despite ongoing conservation action, it is difficult to determine where we stand in overcoming their extinction crisis 1,2. Extinction risk is not equally distributed across amphibians 3-5. Among the most threatened amphibians are the 131 Neotropical harlequin toads (Atelopus), many of which dramatically declined since the late 1980s with several considered possibly extinct 5,6. Recently, more than 30 species have been rediscovered7, raising hope for a reversing trend in the amphibian extinction crisis. We use harlequin toads, for which comprehensive past and present population status, threat and conservation action data are available, as a model for examining whether the amphibian extinction crisis is still in a state of emergency. We show that since 2004 no species has improved its population status, suggesting that the conservation community has not yet bent the curve. Threats such as pathogen spread and habitat change persist unabated; additionally, climate change is expected to be a future threat. More on-the-ground mitigation strategies need implementation, especially habitat protection and disease management, combined with captive conservation breeding. With harlequin toads serving as a model for amphibians with high extinction risk, it is clear that the amphibian extinction crisis is still underway.",,,Research Square,,,,2023-06-06,2023,2023-06-06,,,,,All OA;

Although economic growth lifted a significant share of the population out of poverty and created jobs, Panama still faces structural challenges preventing the emergence of a consolidated middle class and equity across territories. This chapter discusses the main bottlenecks affecting inclusive growth and well-being. It begins with an overview of income patterns in the past decade and then examines the main drivers of inequality. It looks in particular at the role of income redistribution, differences across regions, urban planning, education and skills, and job quality.

The member states of the Central American Integration System (SICA) determined in 2013 that there was an imperative need to address the situation in a comprehensive manner and defined policies for the intervention of the disease. A situation that currently worries health authorities is that cases are on the rise—without distinguishing or implementing effective actions to achieve a decrease in disease prevalence. The incidence of heat and strenuous activities on renal health is undeniable; however, labeling these variables as the only responsible causes for MeN has not catalyzed the implementation of health measures to lead to a preventive approach to solve the epidemic or to achieve a decrease in the number of new cases. This review addresses the role nephrotoxic metals present in the environment, mainly in soils and water, may have as part of a scenario of exposure to environmental toxins in which environmental, occupational, geographic and population variables interact. An integral approach was used to encompass the multicausality that is attributed to MeN and based on the multidisciplinary concept of the re-emerging discipline called medical geology.","We thank Javier Estrada Zeledón, Nephrology Service of the Enrique Baltodano Briceño Hospital, Costa Rica, for reviewing this article.",This research received no external funding.,Geosciences,,,,2023-11-24,2023,2023-11-24,,13,12,360,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valdés-Rodríguez, Benedicto; Montero-Campos, Virginia; Siebecker, Matthew G.","Valdés-Rodríguez, Benedicto (Doctorado en Ciencias Naturales para el Desarrollo (DOCINADE), Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Universidad Nacional and Universidad Nacional Estatal a Distancia, Cartago P.O.

827,pub.1011892048,10.1525/cond.2011.100226,,,Phylogeography of the Rufous-Tailed Hummingbird (Amazilia tzacatl),"The Rufous-tailed Hummingbird (Amazilia tzacatl) is a common resident of the neotropical lowlands of Middle America and northern South America. The Escudo Hummingbird (A. t. handleyi), the most distinctive of the five subspecies of A. tzacatl, is endemic to Isla Escudo in Caribbean western Panama. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation from across most of the species' range showed five well-defined but shallow clades (maximum uncorrected distance 2.4%) that only partially agreed with subspecific taxonomy. A widespread Middle American clade ranges from southeastern Mexico to central Caribbean Panama and includes birds collected on the Bocas del Toro archipelago. The Escudo Hummingbird fell within this clade and was slightly differentiated (two unique substitutions; uncorrected distance ∼0.2–0.5%). Two additional clades occur in the Pacific regions of southern Middle America. A fourth clade is endemic to eastern Panama (eastern Panamá and Darién provinces); a fifth is found in northwestern South America and in Darién. Secondary contact between clades occurs at three sites: between clades I and III in northwestern Costa Rica, between clades I and II in western Panama, and between clades IV and V near the Panama-Colombia border. The last case is likely due to recent expansion into the region from two directions. Thus the history of Amazilia tzacatl demonstrates a tendency for the formation of monophyletic mtDNA clades, likely as the result of geographic isolation, but also a propensity for secondary contact of these clades, a phenomenon recovered in many other phylogeographic studies of neotropical birds.","We thank the collectors and institutions that made tissues available and the permitting agencies of Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize, and Mexico for approving specimen collection.

823,pub.1004198885,10.1111/btp.12214,,,Variation in Canopy Litterfall Along a Precipitation and Soil Fertility Gradient in a Panamanian Lower Montane Forest,"Abstract  Fertilization experiments in tropical forests have shown that litterfall increases in response to the addition of one or more soil nutrients. However, the relationship between soil nutrient availability and litterfall is poorly defined along natural soil fertility gradients, especially in tropical montane forests. Here, we measured litterfall for two years in five lower montane 1‐ha plots spanning a soil fertility and precipitation gradient in lower montane forest at Fortuna, Panama. Litterfall was also measured in a concurrent nitrogen fertilization experiment at one site. Repeated‐measures ANOVA was used to test for site (or treatment), year, and season effects on vegetative, reproductive and total litterfall. We predicted that total litterfall, and the ratio of reproductive to leaf litterfall, would increase with nutrient availability along the fertility gradient, and in response to nitrogen addition. We found that total annual litterfall varied substantially among 1‐ha plots (4.78 Mg/ha/yr to 7.96 Mg/ha/yr), and all but the most aseasonal plot showed significant seasonality in litterfall. However, litterfall accumulation did not track soil nutrient availability; instead forest growing on relatively infertile soil, but dominated by an ectomycorrhizal tree species, had the highest total litterfall accumulation. In the fertilization plots, significantly more total litter fell in nitrogen addition relative to control plots, but this increase in response to nitrogen (13%) was small compared to variation observed among 1‐ha plots. These results suggest that while litterfall at Fortuna is nutrient‐limited, compositional and functional turnover along the fertility gradient obscure any direct relationship between soil resource availability and canopy productivity. 
Resumen Se demostró con experimentos de fertilización en bosques tropicales incrementos en la caída de hojarasca asociados con la adición de nutrientes; empero, se desconoce la relación entre la disponibilidad de nutrientes del suelo con la producción de hojarasca en gradientes naturales de fertilidad del suelo, especialmente en bosques montanos tropicales. Medimos la producción de hojarasca durante dos años en cinco parcelas (1‐ha) en bosques montanos bajos, sobre gradientes de fertilidad y precipitación y en un experimento paralelo de fertilización de nitrógeno en la Reserva Forestal Fortuna, Panamá. Predijimos incrementos de hojarasca total y reproductiva con la disponibilidad de nutrientes en el gradiente de fertilidad del suelo y en respuesta a la adición de nitrógeno (13%). Encontramos que la hojarasca total varía sustancialmente entre parcelas (4.78 Mg/ha/yr hasta 7.96 Mg/ha/yr) y que en todas las parcelas, excepto la menos estacional, hay estacionalidad significativa en la cantidad de hojarasca; pero, la acumulación de hojarasca no coincide con la disponibilidad de nutrientes en el suelo, porque el bosque sobre suelo poco fértil con dominio de una especie ectomicorrícica, presentó mayor acumulación de hojarasca. Las parcelas con fertilización tenían significativamente más hojarasca que las control; pero, el incremento en hojarasca en respuesta a la adición de nitrógeno fue menor respecto a la variación entre parcelas. Los resultados sugieren que mientras la producción de hojarasca en Fortuna es limitada por nutrientes, la variación en la composición de especies a través de gradientes de fertilidad ocultan cualquier relación directa entre la disponibilidad de nutrientes del suelo y la productividad del dosel.","We thank the Government of Panama&#x27;s Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (SENACYT) for providing financial support for this project through the international research collaboration grant COLO08.

815,pub.1124860529,10.1111/jvs.12867,,,EpIG‐DB: A database of vascular epiphyte assemblages in the Neotropics,"Abstract Vascular epiphytes are a diverse and conspicuous component of biodiversity in tropical and subtropical forests. Yet, the patterns and drivers of epiphyte assemblages are poorly studied in comparison with soil‐rooted plants. Current knowledge about diversity patterns of epiphytes mainly stems from local studies or floristic inventories, but this information has not yet been integrated to allow a better understanding of large‐scale distribution patterns. EpIG‐DB, the first database on epiphyte assemblages at the continental scale, resulted from an exhaustive compilation of published and unpublished inventory data from the Neotropics. The current version of EpIG‐DB consists of 463,196 individual epiphytes from 3,005 species, which were collected from a total of 18,148 relevés (host trees and ‘understory’ plots). EpIG‐DB reports the occurrence of ‘true’ epiphytes, hemiepiphytes and nomadic vines, including information on their cover, abundance, frequency and biomass. Most records (97%) correspond to sampled host trees, 76% of them aggregated in forest plots. The data is stored in a TURBOVEG database using the most up‐to‐date checklist of vascular epiphytes. A total of 18 additional fields were created for the standardization of associated data commonly used in epiphyte ecology (e.g. by considering different sampling methods). EpIG‐DB currently covers six major biomes across the whole latitudinal range of epiphytes in the Neotropics but welcomes data globally. This novel database provides, for the first time, unique biodiversity data on epiphytes for the Neotropics and unified guidelines for future collection of epiphyte data. EpIG‐DB will allow exploration of new ways to study the community ecology and biogeography of vascular epiphytes.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank to Stephan Hennekens for adding new functionalities to TURBOVEG, and Gabriela García Reynaga and Leonie Hahn for helping with data standardization. We express our gratitude to those helping with data collection and to several institutions for providing funding for the respective projects, both, people and institutions are indicated in Appendix S2.","Funding information This study was financially supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), funding for GML was provided (ME 5087/1‐1).",Journal of Vegetation Science,,Meelis Pärtel,,2020-04-05,2020,2020-04-05,2020-05,31,3,518-528,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Mendieta‐Leiva, Glenda; Ramos, Flavio N.; Elias, João P.

811,pub.1123904862,10.1002/dac.4309,,,An SDN approach to route massive data flows of sensor networks,"Summary With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), more and more devices can establish a connection with local area networks and use routing protocols to forward all information to the sink. But these devices may not have enough resources to execute a complex routing protocol or to memorize all information about the network. With proactive routing protocols, each node calculates the best path, and it needs enough resources to memorize the network topology. With reactive routing protocols, each node has to broadcast the message to learn the right path that the packets must follow. In all cases, in large networks such as IoT, this is not an appropriate mechanism. This paper presents a new software‐defined network (SDN)–based network architecture to optimize the resource consumption of each IoT object while securing the exchange of messages between the embedded devices. In this architecture, the controller is in charge of all decisions, and objects only exchange messages and forward packets among themselves. In the case of large networks, the network is organized into clusters. Our proposed network architectures are tested with 1000 things grouped in five clusters and managed by one SDN controller. The tests using OpenDayLight and IoT embedded applications have been implemented on several scenarios providing the ability and the scalability from dynamic reorganization of the end‐devices. This approach explores the network performance issues using a virtualized SDN‐clustered environment which contributes to a new model for future network architectures.","This research have been founded by Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (SENACYT) Panama (Grant number 130‐2018).",,International Journal of Communication Systems,,,,2020-01-06,2020,2020-01-06,2020-05-10,33,7,,Closed,Article,"Flauzac, Olivier; Santamaria, Carlos Javier Gonzalez; Nolot, Florent; Woungang, Isaac","Flauzac, Olivier (Laboratory CReSTIC, University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France); Santamaria, Carlos Javier Gonzalez (VIP, Autonomous University of Chiriqui, David, Panama); Nolot, Florent (Laboratory CReSTIC, University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France); Woungang, Isaac (Department of Computer Science, Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada)","Nolot, Florent (University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne)","Flauzac, Olivier (University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne); Santamaria, Carlos Javier Gonzalez (Autonomous University of Chiriqui); Nolot, Florent (University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne); Woungang, Isaac (Toronto Metropolitan University)",14,10,,3.88,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123904862,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

This species strictly produces only five arms, but sometimes, this number varies or show another kind of abnormality. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the population size structure and abnormalities occurrence in the radial pattern of P. cumingi in Bahía Chamela, Jalisco, Mexico. Methods: The population was monitored along four years (2016-2019), in two seasonal periods (warm and cold). During fieldwork, a random sample of individuals was collected. Every starfish was measured, weighted, and evaluated to identify any abnormality on its radial pattern. Results: The highest density of P. cumingi was found in October 2019 (2.03 ± 0.05 ind/m-2), the lower in March 2017 (0.66 ± 0.13 ind/m-2). A total of 849 individuals were collected. For 5-armed starfishes, the average length was 123.8 ± 15.2 mm and the average weight of 326.0 ± 62.4 g. The most frequent length classes ranged from 110 to 120 mm. Of the total of individuals sampled 0.82 % had four arms, 1.06 % six, and 1.41 % had one bifurcated arm. Conclusions: There were differences in the population density and size structure of P. cumingi between seasons. The main causes of abnormalities in the starfish could be due to the changes that occur during larval metamorphosis or by an abnormal regeneration of the arms after a predation attempt.",,,Revista de Biología Tropical,,,,2020-12-01,2020,2020-12-01,,69,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Galván-Villa, Cristian Moisés; Solís-Marín, Francisco Alonso","Galván-Villa, Cristian Moisés (Universidad de Guadalajara); Solís-Marín, Francisco Alonso (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México)",,"Galván-Villa, Cristian Moisés (University of Guadalajara); Solís-Marín, Francisco Alonso (National Autonomous University of Mexico)",2,2,,0.48,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/rbt/article/download/43239/45532,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134497514,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

The World Bank also noted Panama’s progress in the last decade by reporting a remarkable decrease in poverty and increase in access to improved water and sanitation. Despite improvements at the national level, pockets of extreme poverty persist in rural areas, especially in the comarcas, the indigenous provinces of Panama. The first two authors served with the U.S. Peace Corps as water and sanitation volunteers in two such remote communities on the Comarca Ngäbe Buglé. Both observed how the presence of water and sanitation infrastructure could be counted as “coverage” by the national government and bilateral aid agencies. However, without regular water quality testing, system maintenance, or the presence of a regulating body, calculations of “coverage” fail to capture the reality facing Panama’s rural poor. Field research focused on how the connectivity between urban and rural spaces affects water and sanitation system functionality, as well as the relationship between micro-watershed management and water quality.",,,,World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2017,,,2017-05-18,2017,2017-05-18,2017-05-18,,,687-693,Closed,Proceeding,"Miller, Leigh Burgess; Moritz, M.

809,pub.1165872463,10.1038/s43247-023-01069-w,,,Ongoing harlequin toad declines suggest the amphibian extinction crisis is still an emergency,"Biodiversity loss is extreme in amphibians. Despite ongoing conservation action, it is difficult to determine where we stand in overcoming their extinction crisis. Among the most threatened amphibians are the 131 Neotropical harlequin toads. Many of them declined since the 1980s with several considered possibly extinct. Recently, more than 30 species have been rediscovered, raising hope for a reversing trend in the amphibian extinction crisis. We use past and present data available for harlequin toads (Atelopus), to examine whether the amphibian extinction crisis is still in an emergency state. Since 2004 no species has improved its population status, suggesting that recovery efforts have not been successful. Threats include habitat change, pathogen spread and climate change. More mitigation strategies need implementation, especially habitat protection and disease management, combined with captive conservation breeding. With harlequin toads serving as a model, it is clear that the amphibian extinction crisis is still underway.","For help with gathering data on harlequin toads we are grateful to the following colleagues Marvin Anganoy-Criollo, Ariadne Angulo, Jimy Barrantes-Madrigal, Leonardo Batallas, Merilyn A.

Here, we describe and illustrate two new species of Lepanthes from Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. Lepanthes crucitasensis,sp. nov. resembles L. confusa, from which it can be distinguished by longer and wider leaves and flowers with entire margin sepals, longer lateral sepals, longer upper lobe and lip with glabrous appendix. Lepanthes adenophorasp.nov. is similar to L. crucitasensis, but it is distinguished by the narrower leaves, always green, shorter inflorescences, pink scarlet petals with a yellow center and with the upper and lower lobe of different lengths, lip not surpassing the column, appendix with glandular trichomes and obovoid-elliptic pollinia. Micromorphologically, the petals of L. adenophora are pubescent or papillose–hispid. Both new species conform a clade closely related to two species from montane forests, suggesting that some lineages can potentially survive or adapt to warmer habitats. Our results demonstrate that alpha-taxonomic studies are pivotal for uncovering phylogenetic relationships in poorly sampled neotropical orchid groups.","We acknowledge the Ministerio de Ambiente y Energía (MINAE) and Sistema Nacional de Áreas de Conservación (SINAC) of Costa Rica for issuing the scientific permits: 026-2011-SINAC, 073-2012-SINAC, R-SINAC-DE-077, SINAC-SE-GASP-PI-R-019-2015.

804,pub.1134916326,10.1111/btp.12899,,,Association patterns of swollen‐thorn acacias with three ant species and other organisms in a dry forest of Panama,"Abstract  Ants in obligate defense mutualisms with plants protect them against potentially damaging organisms. In the swollen‐thorn acacias, organisms linked to the plant inform about the interaction between the tree and the resident ant colony. Some organisms coexist with the aggressive mutualistic ants: specialized herbivores and organisms using the enemy‐free space. Conversely, trees inhabited by non‐defending ants usually hold a greater load of generalist herbivores and are avoided by organisms looking for the ant protection. We aimed to elucidate the association type between swollen‐thorn acacias ( Vachellia collinsii ) and the almost unstudied Pseudomyrmex simulans ants from Panama. We compared the presence of non‐ant organisms on trees inhabited by P. simulans , a well‐known mutualist ( P. spinicola ) and a facultative parasite (non‐defending ants; Crematogaster crinosa ). We recorded non‐ant organisms (e.g., stem galls, acacia true bugs, spiders) that nest, lay eggs, or live on the trees. Except for stem galls, all other non‐ant organisms were mostly or exclusively found on trees with the mutualists, which is also the most common resident ant. P. simulans is less able to deter galling midges (Cecidomyiidae) than C. crinosa and even less than P. spinicola , because trees with P. simulans were more likely to have galls and in greater densities than on C. crinosa‐trees, and even more than on P. spinicola ‐inhabited trees. The mechanism by which the Cecidomyiids occur in greater proportion on trees with P. simulans and C. crinosa is still unknown, but the pattern indicates an herbivory specialization or a potentially obligate weaker defender of the swollen‐thorn acacias.  Abstract in Spanish is available with online material
RESUMEN  Las hormigas que viven en mutualismos de defensa obligatorios con plantas las protegen contra organismos potencialmente dañinos. Organismos asociados al mutualismo pueden informar sobre el tipo de interacción entre las hormigas residentes y el árbol. Algunos organismos son capaces de coexistir con las hormigas mutualistas: herbívoros especializados y organismos que anidan en la planta usando el espacio libre de enemigos que crean las hormigas agresivas. Por el contrario, árboles habitados por hormigas que no defienden (i.e. parásitas del mutualismo) usualmente tienen una carga mayor de herbívoros y son evitados para anidar por otros organismos. Intentamos entender el tipo de asociación entre árboles de acacia ( Vachellia collinsii ) y unas hormigas poco estudiadas: Pseudomyrmex simulans . Comparamos los organismos en árboles con P. simulans , con los de árboles habitados por una conocida mutualista ( P. spinicola ) y una parásita facultativa ( Crematogaster crinosa ). Muestreamos 1,236 acacias anotando la presencia de las hormigas y otros organismos que anidan o viven en las acacias (e.g. agallas, arañas y chinches de las acacias). Excepto por las agallas, todos los demás organismos estaban en su mayoría o exclusivamente en árboles con la hormiga mutualista, que también es la habitante más común. Los datos muestran que P. simulans es menos capaz de repeler a los dípteros agalladores (Cecidomyiidae) que C. crinosa y aún menos que P. spinicola, pues era más probable que árboles con P. simulans tuvieran agallas, y en densidades mayores que en árboles con C. crinosa y aún más que con P. spinicola . El mecanismo mediante el cual los Cecidomyiidae ocurren en mayor proporción en acacias con P. simulans y C. crinosa aún se desconoce, pero el patrón podría indicar una especialización del herbívoro, o una nueva hormiga obligatoria que es una defensora más débil de la acacia.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are thankful to Enrique Medianero, for help with the identification of the gall, and to John Longino for help identifying the Crematogaster ants.

It discusses Panama’s current multi-level governance architecture, identifying where it should be strengthened to better support the design and implementation of regional development policy. In addition, it evaluates the need for a more strategic approach to regional development and greater capacity in subnational finance, institutional co‑ordination, and quality public service delivery, at all levels of government. A special focus is placed on Panama’s local authorities in light of specific resource challenges and the 2014 decentralisation reform. Finally, the chapter looks into what would be necessary to achieve a strategic shift towards a “place-based” policy approach for regional development, and provides recommendations for action.",,,OECD Development Pathways,Multi-dimensional Review of Panama,,,2018-07-06,2018,,2018-07-06,,,87-135,Closed,Chapter,OECD,OECD (),,OECD (),0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105384572,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

The large area deposition limit is defined as the limit whenever a further increment of the catalytic net area does not affect the properties of the deposited film. This is the case when a dense catalytic net is spread on a surface considerably larger than that of the film substrate. To study this limit, a system able to hold a net of twelve wires covering a surface of about 20 cm × 20 cm was used to deposit amorphous (a‐Si:H) and microcrystalline ( μ c‐Si:H) silicon over a substrate of 10 cm × 10 cm placed at a filament‐substrate distance ranging from 1 to 2 cm. The uniformity of the film thickness d and optical constants, n (x, λ ) and α (x, ħω ), was studied via transmission measurements. The thin film uniformity as a function of the filament‐substrate distance was studied. The experimental thickness profile was compared with the theoretical result obtained solving the diffusion equations. The optimization of the filament‐substrate distance allowed obtaining films with inhomogeneities lower than ±2.5% and deposition rates higher than 1 nm/s and 4.5 nm/s for ( μ c‐Si:H) and (a‐Si:H), respectively.

Our main objective is to review the status of the geodiversity, geoconservation, and geotourism in Central America. We will identify the region’s geomorphic environments and geodiversity using classic regional geomorphology mapping techniques. Likewise, using touristic maps and webpages, we identify the most prominent geosites of different origin in Central America. Moreover, we will explore the national environmental policies, natural conservation systems, and tourism initiatives to promote their national geoheritage through geotourism. We found that volcanic, coastal, karstic, glacial, and fluvial geomorphic environments are the most common in the region. In addition, we identified 393 geosites of volcanic, coastal, karstic, glacial, fluvial, and archeological origin in Central America. The promotion of geoheritage, geodiversity, geoconservation, and thus the development of geoparks are excellent opportunities to promote sustainable development, sustainable lifestyles, appreciation of natural and cultural diversity, and the promotion of peace. These results may prove important to spread information about geoscience widely to decision makers on geotourism and conservation in each country and the stakeholders of the region. Geoheritage studies in tropical and developing countries such as those in Central America should be improved, and priority should be given to the geomorphological dynamics and strong anthropic pressures on their geo- and biodiversity to increase their income through geotourism, especially among the less favored communities and avoid affecting their already threatened natural resources.",Special thanks to Soll Kracher for detailed English style and morphosyntax revision.,"This research was funded by the PAN AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY, grant number GEO 02 and GEOF 03, 2021.",Land,,,,2021-12-29,2021,2021-12-29,,11,1,48,All OA; Gold,Article,"Quesada-Román, Adolfo; Torres-Bernhard, Lidia; Ruiz-Álvarez, Maynor A.; Rodríguez-Maradiaga, Manuel; Velázquez-Espinoza, Gema; Espinosa-Vega, Catalina; Toral, Jaime; Rodríguez-Bolaños, Hugo","Quesada-Román, Adolfo (Escuela de Geografía, Universidad de Costa Rica, San Jose 11501-2060, Costa Rica;, hugo.rodriguezbolanos@ucr.ac.cr); Torres-Bernhard, Lidia (Instituto Hondureño de Ciencias de la Tierra, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras, Tegucigalpa 11101, Honduras;, lidia.torres@unah.edu.hn, (L.T.-B.);, mruiz@unah.edu.hn, (M.A.R.-Á.);, mrodriguez@unah.edu.hn, (M.R.-M.)); Ruiz-Álvarez, Maynor A.

791,pub.1085423631,10.1088/1748-9326/aa6fff,,,A spatio-temporal analysis of forest loss related to cocaine trafficking in Central America,"A growing body of evidence suggests that criminal activities associated with drug trafficking networks are a progressively important driver of forest loss in Central America. However, the scale at which drug trafficking represents a driver of forest loss is not presently known. We estimated the degree to which narcotics trafficking may contribute to forest loss using an unsupervised spatial clustering of 15 spatial and temporal forest loss patch metrics developed from global forest change data. We distinguished anomalous forest loss from background loss patches for each country exhibiting potential 'narco-capitalized' signatures which showed a statistically significant dissimilarity from other patches in terms of size, timing, and rate of forest loss. We also compared annual anomalous forest loss with the number of cocaine shipments and volume of cocaine seized, lost, or delivered at country- and department-level. For Honduras, results from linear mixed effects models showed a highly significant relationship between anomalous forest loss and the timing of increased drug trafficking (F = 9.90, p = 0.009) that also differed significantly from temporal patterns of background forest loss (t-ratio = 2.98, p = 0.004). Other locations of high forest loss in Central America showed mixed results. The timing of increased trafficking was not significantly related to anomalous forest loss in Guatemala and Nicaragua, but significantly differed in patch size compared to background losses. We estimated that cocaine trafficking could account for between 15% and 30% of annual national forest loss in these three countries over the past decade, and 30% to 60% of loss occurred within nationally and internationally designated protected areas. Cocaine trafficking is likely to have severe and lasting consequences in terms of maintaining moist tropical forest cover in Central America. Addressing forest loss in these and other tropical locations will require a stronger linkage between national and international drug interdiction and conservation policies.","We thank the Open Society Foundations Grant No. OR2015-22831 which, in part, provided funding for this research.

Thus, this concern emerges within the framework of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4RI) and the educational problems present in the 21st century, elucidating methodological strategies that lead to the best pedagogical practices, attending to current and future social needs for architecture students; in such a way that the conclusion can be reached as to whether architecture teachers are in training or are trained.",,,Revista Arquitectura +,,,,2023-06-30,2023,2023-06-30,,8,15,2-12,All OA; Gold,Article,"Báez-Álvarez, Fabian Enrique; del Carmen González-Rivera, Katherine; Ángel-Rubiano, Danna Catalina","Báez-Álvarez, Fabian Enrique (Universidad La Gran Colombia, Bogotá D.C, Colombia); del Carmen González-Rivera, Katherine (Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí, David, Panamá); Ángel-Rubiano, Danna Catalina (Universidad La Gran Colombia, Bogotá D.C, Colombia)",,"Báez-Álvarez, Fabian Enrique (La Gran Colombia University); del Carmen González-Rivera, Katherine (Autonomous University of Chiriqui); Ángel-Rubiano, Danna Catalina (La Gran Colombia University)",0,0,,,https://www.camjol.info/index.php/arquitectura/article/download/16270/19400,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160296026,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

Compared to most other phyla, phylogenetic relationships among sponges are still largely unresolved. In the past 10 years, the classical taxonomy has been completely overturned and a review of the state of the art appears necessary. The field of taxonomy remains a prominent discipline of sponge research and studies related to sponge systematics were in greater number in the Eighth World Sponge Conference (Girona, Spain, September 2010) than in any previous world sponge conferences. To understand the state of this rapidly growing field, this chapter proposes to review studies, mainly from the past decade, in sponge taxonomy, nomenclature and phylogeny. In a first part, we analyse the reasons of the current success of this field. In a second part, we establish the current sponge systematics theoretical framework, with the use of (1) cladistics, (2) different codes of nomenclature (PhyloCode vs. Linnaean system) and (3) integrative taxonomy. Sponges are infamous for their lack of characters. However, by listing and discussing in a third part all characters available to taxonomists, we show how diverse characters are and that new ones are being used and tested, while old ones should be revisited. We then review the systematics of the four main classes of sponges (Hexactinellida, Calcispongiae, Homoscleromorpha and Demospongiae), each time focusing on current issues and case studies. We present a review of the taxonomic changes since the publication of the Systema Porifera (2002), and point to problems a sponge taxonomist is still faced with nowadays. To conclude, we make a series of proposals for the future of sponge systematics. In the light of recent studies, we establish a series of taxonomic changes that the sponge community may be ready to accept. We also propose a series of sponge new names and definitions following the PhyloCode. The issue of phantom species (potential new species revealed by molecular studies) is raised, and we show how they could be dealt with. Finally, we present a general strategy to help us succeed in building a Porifera tree along with the corresponding revised Porifera classification.","AcknowledgementsWe would like to acknowledge all the participants of the Eighth World Sponge Conference (Girona, Spain, September 2010) as well as the PorToL workshop (Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, Florida, August 2011) for so many fruitful discussions on sponge systematics.

781,pub.1164262343,10.3390/cryst13091398,,,Numerical Simulations of Space Charge Waves Amplification Using Negative Differential Conductance in Strained Si/SiGe at 4.2 K,"This paper introduces a two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulation of the amplification of space charge waves using negative differential conductance in a typical MOS silicon–germanium (SiGe)-based field-effect transistors (FET) and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology at 4.2 K. The hydrodynamic model of electron transport was applied to describe the amplification of space charge waves in this nonlinear medium (i.e., the negative differential conductance). This phenomenon shows up in GaAs thin films at room temperature. However, this can be also observed in a strained Si/SiGe heterostructure at very low temperatures (T < 77 K) and at high electric fields (E > 10 KV/cm). The results show the amplification and non-linear interaction of space charge waves in a strained Si/SiGe heterostructure occurs for frequencies up to approximately 60 GHz at T = 1.3 K, 47 GHz at T = 4.2 K, and 40 GHz at T = 77 K. The variation of concentration and electric field in the Z and Y directions are calculated at 4.2 K. The electric field in the Z direction is greater than in the Y direction. This is due to the fact that this is the direction of electron motion. In addition to deep space applications, these types of devices have potential uses in terrestrial applications which include magnetic levitation transportation systems, medical diagnostics, cryogenic instrumentation, and superconducting magnetic energy storage systems.",,"This work was supported in part by CONACyT Mexico by Sabbatical fellowship at McMaster University and the PhD Scholarship with CVU number: 626570.

Two of them were periclinal chimeras with altered leaves that had wrinkled dark green margins and inner pale green regions. One chimeric plant had shortened internodes, reduced apical dominance, small flowers and exhibited male sterility, but the other had a normal phenotype. Analysis of proteins, RNA and DNA indicated that the inner pale green tissues consisted of transformed cells while the outer dark green tissues were composed of non-transformed cells. Histological analysis indicated that mesophyll cells were distorted and larger intercellular spaces were present in the transformed pale green regions. Furthermore, in young leaves, transformed mesophyll cells were larger than non-transformed cells. However, the normal parts had larger numbers of cells per unit area than the transformed parts. These observations suggest that ths expression of 35S-rolC in leaves caused inhibition of cell division in developing leaves and that the undulating margins, composed of non-transformed cells, were a consequence of the requirement for accommodating more cells in less space within the region of rolC-transformed cells.",,,Plant and Cell Physiology,,,,1993-07-01,1993,1993-07,1993-07-01,34,5,745-752,Closed,Article,"Oono, Yutaka; Suzuki, Takashi; Toki, Seiichi; Uchimiya, Hirofumi","Oono, Yutaka (Department of Biological Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060 Japan); Suzuki, Takashi (Department of Horticulture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060 Japan); Toki, Seiichi (Department of Biological Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060 Japan); Uchimiya, Hirofumi (Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113 Japan)",,"Oono, Yutaka (Hokkaido University); Suzuki, Takashi (Hokkaido University); Toki, Seiichi (Hokkaido University); Uchimiya, Hirofumi (The University of Tokyo)",12,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1083493548,31 Biological Sciences; 3108 Plant Biology,

The genus consists of 27 species, 22 distributed in the Chiapas Highlands province (Mexican Transition Zone) and 5 found in the Pacific dominion (Neotropical region) in Costa Rica and Panamá. Here, we analyze the phylogenetic relationships of the species of Plumolepilius based on 20 external body characters and 9 characters from the genitalia. The first dichotomy of the cladogram separates two species from the Pacific dominion from the remaining species of Plumolepilius from the Chiapas Highlands province and three species restricted to the Pacific dominion. We hypothesize that redundant distributions in the taxon-area cladogram of the genus may be due to dispersal events, probably during the Pleistocene glaciations.","We thank Robert S.

While much attention has been directed toward the mortality of reef-building corals vis-à-vis various observed disturbances (e.g., bleaching, diseases, overfishing, nutrification), the fate of other reef-associated metazoans, especially invertebrates, has not received sufficient attention. living and dead corals, reef frameworks, and carbonate sediments provide essential habitat niches for a multitude of symbiotic and cryptic species. Thirty-one animal phyla contain species that inhabit coral reefs with known global species richness estimated at 93,000. possibly as many as 1,000,000 reef-associated metazoans occur globally. many of these species are undiscovered because of their cryptic or sibling nature. metazoan reef associates have important functional roles on reefs, e.g., increasing survivorship of coral hosts, aiding in reef framework construction (calcification, consolidation), providing trophic resources, affecting coral mortality (corallivores) and erosion (bioerosion). despite widespread bleaching and mortality, no reef-building corals (scleractinia) have yet to become globally extinct. Three populations of Millepora spp. (Hydroida) were severely impacted in pacific panama during the 1982–83 el niño–southern oscillation event. present status indicates recovery of Millepora intricata milne-edwards and Haime, 1860 to shallow reef zones from relatively deep (10–15 m) refugia. furthermore, two hydrocoral species have suffered regional extinctions in the eastern pacific with populations still present in the Indo-pacific (Millepora platyphylla Hemprich and ehrenberg, 1834) and eastern Indian ocean (Millepora boschmai de Weerdt and Glynn, 1991).

Once released into the environment, they can be dispersed by the wind and deposited in soils and sediments of both marine and inland aquatic systems. After entering the food web, trace elements can accumulate at harmful concentrations in higher trophic levels, including humans. Background concentrations of trace elements such as As, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V and Zn were measured in sediment cores from pristine marine environments near Panama. Temporal records of trace element concentrations and fluxes were determined for the period 1906 to 2017, using the 210Pb dating technique. Higher accumulation rates of trace elements since the 1950s were attributed to an increase in human activities and climate shifts. The enrichment factor in cores was < 2, indicating there has been no substantial human-mediated contamination, and that trace elements were derived mainly from lithogenic sources. Nevertheless, the Threshold Effect Level and Probable Effect Level (TEL and PEL) indicated that Cr, Cu, As, and Ni can pose a risk to biota and therefore to humans, even at natural concentrations. Periodic monitoring of marine environments is recommended to minimize human health risks, reduce detrimental effects to biota, and promote monitoring of human activities that have the potential to cause trace metal contamination.","This study was funded by Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (SENACYT) grant awarded in the field of environmental studies and conservation of wildlife (Project IDDS-015-002).

Despite enclosed photobioreactors (PBRs) provide higher photosynthetic efficiency and CO2 capture capacity than open ponds, the number of studies of PBRs devoted to biogas upgrading is scarce.

Process operation at a biogas flow rate of 14.4 L d−1 during the light period supported a biomethane composition of 95.9 ± 1.3% v/v of CH4, 2.5 ± 0.8% v/v of CO2, 1.4 ± 0.6% v/v of N2, 0.1 ± 0.1% v/v of O2, and negligible H2S concentrations. On the contrary, CH4 and CO2 concentrations of 88.8 ± 1.6% v/v and 9.3 ± 1.1% v/v, respectively, were recorded when biogas was continuously supplied (28.8 L d−1). The oxygenation capacity of the PBR during the light period was sufficient to oxidize NH4 + to NO3 −, which was further used during the dark period to oxidize H2S and prevent microalgae inhibition. Biomass productivity and composition remained constant regardless of the biogas supply regime, with a slight increase in carbohydrate content from 23.6 ± 5.7% (12 h supply) to 30.9 ± 3.5% (continuous supply).","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

These “corporation-based parties” represent a new wave of highly particularized conservative representation in the region. Indeed, corporation-based parties have become a regular—though largely unrecognized—feature of contemporary Latin American party systems. This article develops a theory of how and why particular business conglomerates sponsor their own parties, provides substantial evidence for the existence of corporation-based parties across much of Latin America, and uses a case study of a party built on a Panamanian supermarket chain to demonstrate how such parties are organized.

We illustrate how the application of formative research—focus groups, community visits, and meetings with institutional stakeholders and community key leaders—provides necessary information to develop a health education intervention responding to the Ngäbe-Buglé health-related learning needs, including prenatal care, working with lay midwives, and detection of high-risk pregnancies. Community participants identified the main health priorities—hygiene, nutrition, healthy environments, prenatal care, the role of the lay midwife in the community, and domestic violence. Most of these are relevant to reduce disease burden and mortality rates, mainly pregnancy issues in poor rural settings. Responding to the Ngäbe-Buglé needs, the material included community pictures with local residents and trained 78 health promoters at a centralized location in the Comarca. During the active phase of the project, community health promoters reached over 8000 people at their remote communities, ten times higher than anticipated! Community involvement and participation resulted in community empowerment and adoption of the project. The Ngäbe-Buglé community has continued to implement the intervention, and 6 months after its conclusion, they reported reaching over 11,000 people in their communities. We conclude that inclusion of community members, community participation to develop appropriate educational material, and reinforcement of empowerment is an effective manner to reach indigenous communities with health-related messages, including pregnancy, prenatal care, and the role of the midwife.",,,Global Maternal and Child Health,Maternal Death and Pregnancy-Related Morbidity Among Indigenous Women of Mexico and Central America,David A.

757,pub.1030620199,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01163.x,,,Historical and present distribution of coyote (Canis latrans) in Mexico and Central America,"Aim Coyote (Canis latrans) distribution in Mexico and Central America has expanded recently reaching the Yucatan peninsula, Belize and Panama, probably promoted by deforestation of tropical areas. Historically, the southern distribution of coyotes prior to European settlement in America was described as reaching only as far south as central Mexico and that introduction of livestock favoured migration of coyotes to southern Mexico and Central America. However, coyote fossil records in Central America and Yucatan, as well as observational records of travellers during the sixteenth century suggest that the coyote's arrival to the region was earlier. Because of the uncertainty of past coyote distribution and the possible economic and ecological impacts due to recent range expansion, the objectives of this study were to confirm if paleontological and historical evidence support the hypothesis that the southernmost limit of coyote distribution before the arrival of European settlers was the centre of Mexico, to discuss the possible factors that have influenced historical shifts in coyote distribution, and to model the present distribution of the coyote in Mexico and Central America, determining the areas where they could invade in the near future. Location The research area comprises continental Mexico and the Central American Isthmus countries: Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. Methods The historical distribution (Pleistocene–Early Holocene, Pre‐Columbian, sixteenth to nineteenth centuries and twentieth century) was established from coyote records obtained from museum collections and specialized literature. Present coyote distribution for Mexico and Central America was modelled using the Genetic Algorithms for Rule‐set Prediction (GARP). Results Historical coyote records show that this species was distributed in southern Mexico and Central America during the Pleistocene–Early Holocene, the Pre‐Columbian period, and during the arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century. Coyote records indicate a continuous range expansion during the twentieth century. Historical advance and regression of tropical forests in southern Mexico and Central America produced by natural and human events such as climatic changes and variation in human densities could help us understand the historical coyote distribution. The modelled present‐day coyote distribution included the north of Belize, the north of Panama, the north of the Yucatan Peninsula and a corridor on the Gulf costal plain of Campeche in Mexico. Also, the model predicted a region north of the Darien in southern Panama as appropriate for the presence of coyotes, although they have not been detected there so far. Main conclusion Coyote records in southern Mexico and Central America during the Pleistocene–Early Holocene, the Pre‐Columbian period, and early arrival of European settlers to the area indicated that coyotes were probably already present there and did not recently disperse from the north of Mexico to the south due to livestock introduction. Objetivo La distribución del coyote (Canis latrans) se ha expandido recientemente en México y Centroamérica hasta alcanzar la península de Yucatán, Belice y Panamá, probablemente favorecida por la deforestación en regiones tropicales. Históricamente se ha creído que la distribución de esta especie a la llegada de los colonizadores europeos tenía su limite sur en el centro de México y que la introducción del ganado en el sur de México y Centroamérica favoreció la migración de los coyotes hacia estas áreas. Sin embargo, registros fósiles de coyotes en Centroamérica y Yucatán, así como registros visuales de esta especie por viajeros durante el siglo XVI, sugieren que la llegada de los coyotes a la región fue anterior a lo que previamente se creía. Debido a la controversia sobre la distribución anterior del coyote, así como por los posibles impactos económicos y ecológicos que los coyotes pueden provocar por su reciente expansión, los objetivos de este estudio fueron determinar si la evidencia paleontológica e histórica apoya la hipótesis de que la distribución de esta especie antes de la llegada de los colonizadores europeos llegaba hasta el centro de México, discutir los posibles factores que han influido sobre los cambios históricos en su distribución y modelar la distribución actual del coyote en México y Centroamérica, determinando las áreas que los coyotes pueden invadir en el futuro. Área de Estudio El estudio comprendió la porción continental de México y los países del Istmo Centroamericano: Guatemala, Belice, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica y Panamá. Métodos Se estableció la distribución histórica del coyote (Pleistoceno‐Holoceno temprano, Precolombina, siglos XVI al XIX y siglo XX) a partir de registros de coyotes obtenidos de colecciones científicas de museos y literatura especializada. Se modeló la distribución actual del coyote en México y Centroamérica usando algoritmos genéticos (GARP). Resultados Los registros históricos de coyote indican que la especie estuvo distribuida en el sur de México y Centroamérica durante el Pleistoceno‐Holoceno temprano, la etapa Precolombina y a la llegada de los europeos en el siglo XVI. Los registros indican un incremento continuo en el área de distribución del coyote durante el siglo XX. El avance y contracción de los bosques tropicales en el sur de México y Centroamérica debido a causas naturales y humanas, tales como cambios climáticos o variación de las densidades humanas, pueden ayudar a entender la distribución histórica del coyote. La distribución actual de esta especie obtenida a través del modelo, reconoce que puede estar presente al norte de la península de Yucatán y la llanura costera del Golfo de Campeche en México, y en Centroamérica, el norte de Belice y el norte de Panamá. Además, el modelo muestra que, aún cuando la especie no ha llegado a la región norte de Darién en el sur de Panamá, dicho lugar es apropiado para ser invadido por los coyotes. Conclusiones Principales Los registros de coyotes en el sur de México y Centroamérica en el Pleistoceno‐Holoceno temprano, la época Precolombina y durante las primeras etapas de la Colonia Española indican que los coyotes probablemente ya estaban presentes en el área a la llegada de los colonizadores europeos, y no se dispersaron recientemente hacia el sur de México y Centroamérica desde el centro de México con la introducción de la ganadería en el área.","We wish to thank all the curators and staff of the museums and mammal collections that kindly provided information about their coyote holdings: the American Museum of Natural History, the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, the California Academy of Sciences, the Field Museum of Natural History, the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural History, the San Diego Natural History Museum (Bird and Mammal Department), the British Museum, the United States National Museum of Natural History, the Mammal Collection of the Instituto de Biología UNAM, the Mammal Collection of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the Michigan State University in Lansing and the Moore Laboratory of Zoology at Occidental College.

As such, two native Xylaria spp. and an exotic mushroom Trametes versicolor were incubated on the spent substrate (Residues of B. Graveolens, BGR’s). The relatively high lignin and cellulose contents of the BGRs (9.1% and 19%, respectively) indicated the potential of this resource for the production of methane (biogas) and ethanol. However, the degradation of the lignin and cellulose content could be traced back to the relatively high activity of the enzymes laccase, cellulase, and xylanase, produced by the fungi. The results showed that laccase (30.0 U/L and 26.6 U/L), cellulase (27.3 U/L and 35.8 U/L) and xylanase (189.7U/L and 128.3 U/L) activities of Xylaria feejeensis and Xylaria cf. microceras were generally higher than T. versicolor (9.0 U/L, 29.5 U/L, 99.5 U/L respectively). Furthermore, the total carbon (TC: 47.3%), total nitrogen (TN: 1.5%), total phosphorus (TP: 0.2%) and total potassium (TK: 1.2%) dynamics were analyzed during the experiment and their importance for the degradation process highlighted. The results of this work might serve as guidance for future studies in dry forest areas, while furthering the understanding of the potential use of native fungi as ecologic lignocellulosic decomposers and for industrial proposes.","We would like to thank the Secretary of Science and Technology of Ecuador (SENESCYT), the Ecuadorian Ministry of the Environment (MAE, research permits 015-IC-UPN-DRLEOZCH-MA and 027-2013-DPL-MA) and the Department of Biological Sciences of the Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja for their support.

Whereas in the 1980 census round very few Latin American countries of the region included ethnic identity questions, in the 2000 census round they practically all did so, in response to the State obligations. When they were ""objects"" of policy it was assumed that indigenous peoples could be identified–indirectly and by non–indigenous people– by externally or culturally manifested features, particularly their language.

Molecular phylogenetics has changed our perception of the diversity of higher taxonomic lineages and morphologies in the class as well as our understanding of how these clades are related to one another. Leotiomycetes are found in all environments where researchers have explored and have myriad ecological strategies – including economically important pathogens (e.g., powdery mildews on various plants and the causal agent of the white-nose syndrome of bats), endophytes, saprobes, and mycorrhizae. In this article, we provide a summary of the morphological and ecological diversity of Leotiomycetes, and an overview of the taxonomic diversity and systematics. Major challenges in studying this group include historical biases in sampling outside of temperate Europe and North America and a lack of sequence data for many taxa especially in the sprawling mega-order Helotiales. With the help of environmental sequencing and genomic-scale data, researchers are beginning to reveal new perspectives on Leotiomycetes ecology, evolution, and systematics.",,,,Encyclopedia of Mycology,,,2021,2021,,2021,,,284-294,Closed,Chapter,"Quandt, C.

The coral reefs in this region have a relatively limited suite of species compared to other coral reef areas of the world, but much like more diverse reefs the species present interact in complex ways. Here we synthezise the knowledge of taxonomic groups of reef organisms from prokaryotes to vertebrates, including algae, sponges, cnidarians, annelids and other worms, molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms and fishes. We also present summaries on the biodiversity of associated functional groups and habitats, including (a) reef zooplankton and cryptic fauna, and (b) soft benthic environments, rhodolith beds and mesophotic environments. Several factors that structure the biodiversity of ETP coral reefs are explored, including biological, physical and chemical controls. ETP coral reefs are relatively simple systems that can be used as models for studying biodiversity and interactions among species. We conclude this review by highlighting pressing research needs, from very basic inventories to more sophisticated studies of cryptic assemblages, and to investigations on the impacts of natural and anthropogenic effects on ETP coral reef biodiversity.","We thank Peter W.

In the small Central American country of Panama, the Ngäbe-Buglé are two distinct indigenous groups with similar cultural and linguistic characteristics combined into one general Comarca or indigenous reservation, making it the largest indigenous group in Panama (over 280,000 individuals). Although Panama presents a thriving economy, occupying second place in the region after Chile, indigenous groups face extreme poverty. Their poor living conditions, coupled with a treacherous mountainous terrain and limited healthcare infrastructures and service delivery, place them at high risk to develop numerous diseases. These include high rates of maternal and child mortality (48/100,000) as compared to urban areas of Panama (13/100,000). Allopathic clinicians working at the community level, with inclusion of lay midwives, can help to bring positive change to this forgotten population and alleviate the burden of unequal maternal, pregnancy, and reproductive health outcomes. Since the early 1990s, the Ministry of Health of Panama has provided training to lay midwives of the Ngäbe-Buglé Comarca to prevent further maternal and child deaths occurring during pregnancy, birthing, and postpartum. Also, additional training related to reproductive health is provided to the midwives.","A special thanks to the Panama Ministry of Health Department of Indigenous Health Issues (Departamento de Asuntos Indígenas) and to the Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health, especially to Drs.

However, uncertainty remains within several subtribes and genera for which phylogenetic relationships have not ever been tested in a phylogenomic context. To address these knowledge-gaps, we here provide the most extensively sampled analysis of the orchid family to date, based on 78 plastid coding genes representing 264 species, 117 genera, 18 tribes and 28 subtribes. Divergence times are also provided as inferred from strict and relaxed molecular clocks and birth-death tree models. Our taxon sampling includes 51 newly sequenced plastid genomes produced by a genome skimming approach. We focus our sampling efforts on previously unplaced clades within tribes Cymbidieae and Epidendreae. Our results confirmed phylogenetic relationships in Orchidaceae as recovered in previous studies, most of which were recovered with maximum support (209 of the 262 tree nodes). We provide for the first time a clear phylogenetic placement for Codonorchideae within subfamily Orchidoideae, and Podochilieae and Collabieae within subfamily Epidendroideae. We also identify relationships that have been persistently problematic across multiple studies, regardless of the different details of sampling and genomic datasets used for phylogenetic reconstructions. Our study provides an expanded, robust temporal phylogenomic framework of the Orchidaceae that paves the way for biogeographical and macroevolutionary studies.","We would like to thank Esteban Urrea for helping with the bioinformatics pipelines.

Americanae, Moraceae)","Abstract  Ficus (Moraceae) is one of the most diverse genera of tree species in the world. The subgenus Spherosuke , section Americanae , comprises several species complexes because its diagnostic structures are extremely variable. Currently, neither there is a phylogenetic hypothesis that can help solve the delimitation problems within these complexes nor has an integrative taxonomic approach been developed. In the present study, morphometric methods were applied to solve the taxonomic problems in the Ficus aurea complex. Morphometric variation of syconia and leaves was analyzed to find differences between four previously recognized forms (fo. aurea , fo. cookii , fo. isophlebia , and fo. tuerckheimii ). Syconium characters were analyzed using traditional morphometrics, while leaf shape was evaluated with geometric morphometrics, encompassing 20 populations along two‐thirds of the distribution range of the complex. Data sets from syconia and leaves were tested for possible associations with geographic and rainfall variables. There are significant differences between the four forms in syconium characters and leaf shape. Geography and rainfall variables show significant covariation related to the morphometric variation of syconia but not to leaf shape. Consequently, we propose that the four forms should be repositioned into the specific rank. Besides, F. tecolutensis is also recognized as a separated species from form aurea considering Principal Component Analysis, field observations, and herbarium specimens. An identification key, descriptions, as well as taxonomic comments of the species are provided.","Acknowledgements This study is part of the doctoral research of Karen Beatriz Hernández‐Esquivel and is a requisite to obtain her degree.

Capparaceae have a pantropical distribution, although traditionally they have been considered mainly to be distributed in dry areas and therefore influenced by climatic constraints. We carried out an analysis of endemicity (NDM/VNDM) using 7602 records of 21 genera and 104 species in order to test whether climatic constraints of NSDF have shaped endemic species and areas of endemism of Capparaceae geographically confined to NSDF floristic nuclei. A total of three genera (monogeneric) and 29 endemic species included in 38 areas of endemism and 14 consensus areas were recovered. From Consensus areas, we proposed five generalized areas of endemism, mainly located in NSDF: Lower Central America, Northern South America, Northwestern South America, Northeastern South America and Central South of South America. However, only one of them (Lower Central America, located in Panama) is not related to NSDF. These outcomes allow us to suggest that the distributional patterns of Capparaceae, represented by the areas of endemism, were mainly affected by the tectonics and climatic fluctuations that shaped the current distribution of NSDF.","J.D.M.G. gives thanks for the doctoral scholarships 647 from COLCIENCIAS and ‘Universidad de Sucre’ for the financial support during his doctoral studies.

The disagreement and negotiations over limits between countries revealed the wide-reached interest in delineation of national territories, fundamental for the formation of independent nation-states. Several ideological and economic factors affected the dispute and the final boundary treaty between Guatemala and Mexico. An important ideological influence played the nineteenth-century romantic nationalism, which made the Creole elites to establish particular and unique national entities. Moreover, the worldwide drive to map the earth‘s surface by using tools of the modern cartographic science played an important role in the process of Mexican-Guatemalan boundary definition. The postcolonial expansion of agro-export economy in Central America, and especially the coffee boom starting in the Mexican southeastern and Guatemalan western borderlands from the second half of the nineteenth century onward became an economic stimulus for boundary definition process. This is the historical context, in which Mexican and Guatemalan elites were engaged in a long-running debate and negotiations over the common border.",,,Diálogos Revista Electrónica,,,,2011-08-16,2011,2011-08-16,,3,1,29-52,All OA; Gold,Article,"Buska, Soili","Buska, Soili (Universidad de Costa Rica)",,"Buska, Soili (University of Costa Rica)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/dialogos/article/download/6285/5987,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104195863,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

However, the discipline has not developed theoretical approaches regarding the independence process, which is considered more a concern of the international law and the political interests of state actors. Then, in this article, the issue of independence is analyzed as a basic step for political entities to access statehood, becoming a basisfor understanding the role of the independent state in the Westphalian order. It is necessary to observe the variations in the conception of independence, especially regarding self-determination and recognition principle, acknowledging the existence of deep changes in the international system. This principle has had greater relevance since the 1990s due to the disintegration processes of some countries, particularly the case of Kosovo. Taiwan is also a relevant experience. Another key point is the weakening process of the state, with the appearance of variants that question the status and existence of the state actor. At the end of this paper, a brief reference is made to the Latin and Central American experience, which shows particularities since the 19th century. 
El actor central en las relaciones internacionales es el Estado soberano independiente, según la naturaleza del sistema westfaliano; sin embargo, en la disciplina no se han desarrollado enfoques teóricos sobre el proceso de independencia.

Por ello, se analiza en este trabajo, la cuestión de la independencia como un paso básico para que las entidades políticas accedan a la categoría de Estado, lo que sirve de fundamento para entender el papel del Estado independiente en el orden westfaliano. Al reconocer que hay cambios profundos en el sistema internacional, es necesario observar las variaciones en la concepción de independencia, sobre todo en relación con el principio de autodeterminación y el reconocimiento.Esto tiene mayor relevancia a partir de la década de 1990, por los procesos de desintegración de algunos países, en particular, el caso de Kosovo; otra experiencia relevante es Taiwán.

722,pub.1085199656,10.1111/jvs.12540,,,Soils and rainfall drive landscape‐scale changes in the diversity and functional composition of tree communities in premontane tropical forest,"Abstract  Questions Premontane tropical forests harbour exceptionally high plant species diversity; understanding which factors influence their species composition is critical to conserving them, and to predicting how global environmental change will affect them. We asked: (1) how do α‐ and β‐diversity vary at the landscape scale; (2) how important is environmental filtering in structuring these communities; and (3) which soil and climate variables account for the most compositional variation?   Location Old‐growth premontane forest, Fortuna Forest Reserve, western Panama.   Methods  All trees ≥5‐cm DBH were censused in 12 1‐ha plots up to 13 km apart. For each plot, we measured soil properties (0–10 cm depth) at 13 locations, and estimated or measured monthly rainfall. To evaluate how the environmental and spatial variables are associated with community composition, we used ordination and Mantel tests.    Results  Diversity varied nearly three‐fold among plots (68–184 species·ha −1 ). β‐Diversity was also high, with only one of 364 species present in all plots. Turnover reflected distinct forest community types that have developed on different parent materials: forests on rhyolite had an abundance of either ectomycorrhizal‐associated trees or canopy palms, while forests on the other rock types (andesite, dacite and basalt) were dominated by trees that form arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. While NMDS ordination showed that species turnover was significantly correlated with rainfall seasonality, and also co‐varied with geographic distance. Nonetheless, large compositional differences were apparent among sites <2 km apart with similar rainfall but differing soils. Partial Mantel tests controlling for geographic distance highlighted the relationship between total phosphorus and species composition.    Conclusions Soil nutrient availability and rainfall seasonality in premontane forests at Fortuna are associated with striking variation in the taxonomic and functional composition of nearby tree communities, and with plot differences in species richness comparable in magnitude to those reported over >1000 m a.s.l. in previous studies. Accounting for how local edaphic conditions structure premontane and montane tropical forests will be critical to predicting how tree communities will respond to climate change.","We thank Panama&#x27;s Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (SENACYT) for financial support through grant COLO‐08 and additional funding from the University of Illinois Research Board.

In suburban areas and central neighborhoods, traffic and parking literally occupy the streets, making them harder to use by children on foot or on bicycle, much less for non-transport purposes, such as playing. Why are child- and youth-friendly streets so important? How can streets become more inclusive places? This chapter makes a plea for taking children, youth, and their activities into account in the design and development of street networks. It puts forward traffic calming as a useful tool for making streets safer and more versatile, and supportive of social interaction. Furthermore, this chapter highlights the legitimate presence of the children and youth in the streets and the importance of their insightful participation in urban planning and design process.",,,,The Routledge Handbook of Designing Public Spaces for Young People,"Janet Loebach, Sarah Little, Adina Cox, Patsy Eubanks Owens",,2020-06-03,2020,2020-06-03,2020-06-03,,,52-63,Closed,Chapter,"Torres, Juan","Torres, Juan ()",,"Torres, Juan ()",1,1,,0.32,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128218975,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 44 Human Society",3 Good Health and Well Being

We tested the effects of environmental and dispersal factors in structuring root-associated fungi at a regional scale. We used Illumina sequencing to document fungi on the roots of Oreomunnea mexicana in Panama and Mexico and Alfaropsis roxburghiana in China. Ectomycorrhizal fungi dominated the communities with both hosts but we detected a more diverse root-associated fungal community in Alfaropsis but higher ectomycorrhizal fungi richness in Oreomunnea. Geographic distance was the best predictor of variation in fungal species composition, when including both hosts and when analyzing each host independently. However, our results showed a high correlation between geographic distance and abiotic variables, and therefore we were not able to determine if the observed changes in fungal community composition were explained also by spatially structured environmental or phylogenetic factors.","We greatly appreciate Jack and Kathy Ewel, the EWEL postdoctoral fellowship, and the University of Florida International Center for funding this project.

718,pub.1053127799,10.1007/s10531-007-9269-0,,,Conservation priorities for carnivores considering protected natural areas and human population density,"We conducted a prioritization exercise for 47 terrestrial carnivores in North and Central America. We used 2 by 2 degree cells to explore the spatial patterns in overall richness, regionally endemic and threatened species and identified the hotspots (the top 10% of cells in each category). We obtained optimal minimum sets of cells to represent each carnivore either (1) at least once, (2) three times, or (3) in at least 10% of its regional distribution range. Our analysis considered cells with 50% or more of their area protected, and considered human population density (HPD) per grid cell, excluding the top 10% cells with higher HPD. We found low congruence among hotspots, suggesting these should not be used alone in directing conservation strategies. About 7, 18 and 84 grid cells are needed to reach each representation goal, respectively. A much higher number of protected cells are needed to achieve the same goals. Representing 10% of each species’ distribution range required optimal sets of 47 additional cells to complement the protected cells. Irreplaceable cells had a similar or higher HPD than average values for all cells. By excluding the top 10% of cells with higher HPD, irreplaceable cells in optimal sets had much lower average HPD, but three species cannot be represented at all. By defining conservation priorities and proposing optimal networks of areas needed to represent all carnivores in the region, actual conservation efforts can be reviewed and revised. Furthermore, if our results are incorporated into a general strategy, limited resources available to conserve carnivores might be directed more efficiently.","We thank technical support of G.

Within this context, updated local and regional checklists of alien species are crucial to design biosecurity protocols and strategies for the management of invasive species. In this study, we compiled a comprehensive dataset of the alien flora of Central America based on newly gathered information from the literature, herbarium records, and consultations with local experts. This new dataset includes information on taxonomy, geographic origin, pathways of introduction, habitats preferences, and economic uses of alien plant species introduced to this region. The alien flora of Central America comprises 1228 species, among which there are 835 (68%) naturalized species and 393 (32%) casuals. The number of aliens varied considerably among countries, with the highest numbers occurring in Costa Rica (957 species) and the lowest in Belize (226 species). Alien species can be sourced to all continents and are dominated by herbs, trees, and shrubs. Most species (60%) were introduced intentionally as ornamentals. Alien species have successfully established and are spreading across all major habitat types in the region, and this may have significant long-term implications for the conservation of native biodiversity but also within the socio-economic context of this region.","E.C-M was supported by Universidad de Costa Rica-Vicerrectoría de Investigación through the project 01-401-2022.

713,pub.1130635797,10.1111/btp.12842,,,Chemical defenses shift with the seasonal vertical migration of a Panamanian poison frog,"Abstract  Dendrobatid poison frogs sequester lipophilic alkaloids from their arthropod prey to use as a form of chemical defense. Some dendrobatid frogs seasonally migrate between the leaf litter of the forest floor in the dry season to the canopy in the wet season, which may yield differences in prey (arthropods) and therefore alkaloid availability over space and time. Here, we document a seasonal vertical migration of Andinobates fulguritus (the yellow‐bellied poison frog) from ground to canopy between dry and wet seasons. We observed turnover in alkaloid composition between seasons and found that dry season frogs contained a lower relative quantity of alkaloids; however, there was no change in alkaloid richness between seasons. The 77 alkaloids of 13 structural classes identified in this population appear to be derived mostly from mites and ants, though the two most common alkaloids were mite derived. Our observed shifts in defensive profiles are consistent with well‐documented turnover in mite and ant communities between seasons and vertical strata. As climate change is expected to lengthen and strengthen dry seasons in many tropical regions, our results suggest that arboreal poison frogs forced to the ground for longer periods of time may see a shift in the abundance of alkaloids, possibly decreasing their defensive potential. This study provides further predictions for the wide‐reaching effects of climate change, even as nuanced as charismatic poison frogs losing their poisons.  Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.
Resumen Las ranas venenosas dendrobatidas secuestran alcaloides lipofílicos de sus presas de artrópodos para usarlas como una forma de defensa química. Algunas ranas dendrobatidas migran estacionalmente entre la hojarasca del suelo del bosque en la estación seca al dosel en la estación húmeda, lo que puede generar diferencias en presa (artrópodos) y, por la tanto, en la disponibilidad de alcaloides en el espacio y el tiempo. Aquí, documentamos una migración vertical estacional de Andinobates fulguritus (la rana venenosa de vientre amarillo) del suelo al dosel entre las estaciones seca y húmeda. Observamos una rotación en la composición de alcaloides entre estaciones y encontramos que las ranas de la estación seca contenían una cantidad relativa menor de alcaloides; sin embargo, no hubo cambios en la riqueza de alcaloides entre las estaciones. Los 77 alcaloides de 13 clases estructurales identificados en esta población parecen derivar principalmente de ácaros y hormigas, aunque los dos alcaloides más comunes fueron derivados de ácaros. Nuestros cambios observados en los perfiles defensivos son consistentes con una rotación bien documentada en comunidades de ácaros y hormigas entre estaciones y estratos verticales. Como se espera que el cambio climático alargue y fortalezca las estaciones secas en muchas regiones tropicales, nuestros resultados sugieren que las ranas venenosas arbóreas forzadas al suelo por periodos más largos de tiempo podrían ver un cambio en la abundancia de alcaloides, posiblemente disminuyendo su potencial defensivo. Este estudio proporciona más predicciones para los efectos de gran alcance del cambio climático, incluso tan matizados como las carismáticas ranas venenosas perdiendo sus venenos.","Financial support was generously provided by the American Museum of Natural History&#x27;s Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Grant, and the Lewis and Clark Fund.

We calculated rates of mortality due to nest poaching in 23 studies of Neotropical parrots, representing 4024 nesting attempts in 21 species and 14 countries. We also examined how poaching rates vary with geographic region, presence of active protection programs, conservation status and economic value of a species, and passage of the U.S. Wild Bird Conservation Act. The average poaching rate across all studies was 30% of all nests observed. Thirteen studies reported poaching rates of ≥20%, and four reported rates openface> 70%. Only six studies documented no nest poaching. Of these, four were conducted on islands in the Caribbean region, which had significantly lower poaching rates than the mainland Neotropics. The other two studies that showed no poaching were conducted on the two species with the lowest economic value in our sample ( U.S. retail price). In four studies that allowed direct comparison between poaching at sites with active nest protection versus that at unprotected sites, poaching rates were significantly lower at protected sites, suggesting that active protection efforts can be effective in reducing nest poaching. In those studies conducted both before and after the passage of the U.S. Wild Bird Conservation Act, poaching rates were found to be significantly lower following its enactment than in the period before. This result supports the hypothesis that the legal and illegal parrot trades are positively related, rather than inversely related as has been suggested by avicultural interests. Overall, our study indicates that poaching of parrot nestlings for economic gain is a widespread and biologically significant source of nest mortality in Neotropical parrots. 
   Resumen: Aunque se piensa que el saqueo de polluelos para el mercado de mascotas contribuye a la declinación de muchas especies de loros, no se han demostrado sus efectos. Calculamos las tasas de mortalidad debido al saqueo de nidos en 23 estudios de loros neotropicales, que representan 4,024 intentos de anidar en 21 especies y 14 países. También examinamos la variación de las tasas de saqueo por región geográfica, la presencia de programas activos de protección, el estatus de conservación y el valor económico de las especies y la aprobación del Acta de Conservación de Aves Silvestres de E. U. A. La tasa promedio de saqueo en todos los estudios fue del 30% del total de nidos observados. Trece estudios reportaron tasas de saqueo ≥20% y 4 estudios reportaron el saqueo de> 70%. Solo 6 estudios no documentaron saqueo de nidos. De estos, 4 se llevaron a cabo en islas de la región del Caribe, que tuvieron niveles de saqueo significativamente menores que en el continente. Los otros dos estudios que no mostraron saqueo se llevaron a cabo con las 2 especies de menor valor económico en nuestra muestra ( precio de venta en E.U.A.). En cuatro estudios que permitieron comparaciones directas entre el saqueo en sitios con protección activa de nidos versus sitios sin protección, las tasas de saqueo fueron significativamente menores en los sitios protegidos, lo que sugiere que los esfuerzos activos de protección pueden ser efectivos para reducir el saqueo de nidos. En los estudios llevados a cabo antes y después de la aprobación del Acta de Conservación de Aves Silvestres de E. U. A., las tasas de saqueo fueron significativamente menores después que antes de la probación del Acta. Este resultado apoya a la hipótesis de que el comercio legal e ilegal de loros están positivamente relacionados, y no inversamente relacionados como sugieren los intereses de aricultura. En conclusión, nuestro estudio indica que el saqueo de pollos de loros para su venta es un factor de mortalidad de nidos de loros neotropicales generalizado y biológicamente significativo.","We thank J.

In dialogue with the Caribbean literature, I show how the locally established contrasts between before and today, as well as the existence of the distinct neighborhoods of the village, expressed the historical process of space occupation, based on the use, inheritance and collective ownership of family land. Finally, connext Ingold's argument about landscape with ethnographic data, underlining how Old Bank´s time and space are created through the relationship between human beings and God.

Em diálogo com a literatura caribenha, mostro como os contrastes localmente estabelecidos entre “antigamente e hoje, assim como a existência dos distintos bairros da vila eram expressões do processo histórico de ocupação do espaço, fundado no uso, herança e posse coletiva da “terra familiar”.

In 1987–88, sediments were highly polluted by organic matter and inorganic contaminants. Although the amount of silt–clay in the sediments diminished from 95 to 25% during the intervening 20-year period and significant improvements were observed in the content of polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, their metal content was still very high. However, the benthic community currently showed a clear increase in complexity and diversity. It changed from an assemblage that was 98%-dominated by the Capitella capitata complex to an assemblage dominated by Mediomastus fragilis, Capitella capitata and Ophryotrocha hartmanni. By 2008, more species were found and there was increased representation from different trophic groups, whereas the abundance and biomass values were clearly reduced by almost two and one order of magnitude, respectively. Mean annual density evolved from 385,261 ind. m–2 with a mean annual biomass of 12.75 g dry wt m–2 in 1987–88 to 8155 ind. m–2 and 0.94 g dry wt m–2 in 2008. Using a regression model that allowed comparability between both sets of data, secondary production of the community was reduced from 207.7 g dry wt m–2 year–1 in 1987–88 to 8.0 g dry wt m–2 year–1 in 2008. The organic input decreased, but the metal concentration present in the sediments may inhibit their full recovery to normal conditions.","The authors wish to thank the original project SPIO (1987-88), funded by the former Ministry of Public Works and the ‘Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona’.

696,pub.1100234540,10.1093/botlinnean/box087,,,Pollination of Trichosalpinx (Orchidaceae: Pleurothallidinae) by biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae),"Pleurothallidinae (Epidendreae) are a megadiverse Neotropical orchid subtribe comprising > 5100 species, most of which are probably pollinated by Diptera. The role of pollinators as drivers of species diversity is largely unknown because knowledge of pollination systems in Pleurothallidinae is still scarce. Here, we addressed the pollination of Trichosalpinx s.s. through study of floral anatomy, pollinator behaviour and floral traits shared with other angiosperms to elucidate its pollination mechanisms. We identified midge specimens with DNA barcoding and morphology, documented pollination with video recordings, studied the anatomy of flowers by combining microscopy (light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) and histochemistry and analysed floral scents with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. We found that two Trichosalpinx spp. are pollinated exclusively by female biting midges of a Forcipomyia (Euprojoannisia) sp. (Ceratopogonidae). The midges land on the motile lip and appear to suck substances from its papillose surface. We detected secretion of carbohydrates and proteins on the lip and sepals, and thus, Trichosalpinx might stimulate a protein collection instinct in female biting midges. The well-developed mandibles and poorly developed laciniae of the pollinators indicate that they mainly feed on invertebrate hosts from which they draw haemolymph. Thus, Trichosalpinx flowers offer small quantities of proteins and carbohydrates that may act as flavour teases and together with the colour, fragrances, trichomes and movement of the lip, they probably form part of a complex deceptive system. Some other angiosperms that are also pollinated by biting midges possess similar dark purple flowers with ciliate ornamentation and use myophily, sapromyophily or kleptomyiophily as strategies to exploit different families of Diptera as pollinators. One Forcipomyia sp. (Euprojoannisia) is kleptoparasitic, suggesting that kleptomyiophily may have evolved in Trichosalpinx. The similar floral morphology among members of Trichosalpinx and some species of the closely related genera Anathallis and Lankesteriana suggests that they are also pollinated by biting midges.","We acknowledge the Ministerio de Ambiente y Energía (MINAE) and Sistema Nacional de Áreas de Conservación (SINAC) of Costa Rica for issuing scientific permits: 026-2011-SINAC, 073-2012-SINAC, R-SINAC-DE-077 and SINAC-SE-GASP-PI-R-019-2015.

This paper provides an overview of representative advances in in-situ ocean observation during the past decade. Major driving forces and representative advances and trends in in-situ observation are described. Advances are discussed under the categories of observation infrastructure and major measurement system components including sensor, platform, data collection and telemetry, and power supply. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a major participant of the global ocean observation programs and examples of its contributions and activities are introduced.",,,,Volume 4: Ocean Engineering; Offshore Renewable Energy,,,2008-01-01,2008,2009-07-27,2008-01-01,,,983-994,Closed,Proceeding,"Shih, H.

Rhodolith beds are a common feature of subtidal environments and have been recognized as important carbonate producers and paleoenvironmental indicators, as well as recognized as habitat-forming species. The rhodolith structure provides a hard three-dimensional substrate serving as microhabitat for a wide range of biodiversity, including commercially importance species. The largest known latitudinal occurrence range of rhodolith beds ais on the Brazilian coastal shelf from 2°N to 25°S. Despite their importance for the Brazilian benthic communities, only in the last decade sampling efforts allowed a more comprehensive understanding of the beds' distribution, their structure and associated communities, as well as data concerning the influence of environmental factors on rhodolith bed structure and dynamics. In this work, we review the available information on the biodiversity associated with the recently described Brazilian rhodolith beds of the continental shelf and oceanic islands, focusing on the associated organisms with potential for bioprospection research.",,,Revista Brasileira de Farmacognosia,,,,2012-08,2012,2012-08,,22,4,782-788,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Amado-Filho, Gilberto M.; Pereira-Filho, Guilherme H.","Amado-Filho, Gilberto M.

Our report shows that due to high-energy waves, coastal deposits on points or islands with a northern exposure contain massive biocalcarenite deposits derived from mollusk shells, while areas of lower water energy located on coastal areas facing east or west commonly accumulate the crushed debris of coralline red algae, both as beach and dune deposits. Sheltered areas along any point or island oriented to the south will most likely attract colonization by coral reefs. Isla del Carmen clearly displays all these different types of biogenic deposits, making it an ideal model for the development of coastal carbonates throughout the western Gulf of California. Equally important, the general model has been persistent since early Pliocene times for the whole region. In particular for Isla del Carmen, this scenario precludes any tectonic block rotation, postulated in previous reports.","Participation by Carreño and Ledesma-Vázquez was supported by a grant from the Universidad Autonoma de Mèxico PAIIT IN102211.

Four sightings were made in 2022 during boat-based surveys off the southwestern coast of Nicaragua. Photo-identification, distributional data, dive times, and behavioural information were collected, and environmental parameters, including sea surface temperature, were measured for each sighting. Sightings included calf and non-calf groups displaying travelling ( n = 1; 25%), milling ( n = 1; 25%), and suspected feeding ( n = 2; 50%) behaviours. Approximately 4 h of focal following allowed the calculation of short and long breath intervals. Based on our observations, the individuals were suspected of feeding in the area, based on the presence of feeding birds, feeding humpback whales, relatively high time-lagged chlorophyll-a, and observed general behaviours. Our findings indicate that this species may occasionally visit Nicaraguan coastal areas in search of feeding opportunities, and could represent a possible range extension of the Eastern North Pacific stock.","Special thanks to our captain Noel Lugo for his work during the fieldwork.

During fieldwork in eastern Panama in 2011 and 2012 we found six additional species, four of which we are describing here as new to science, plus two species that are new for this region. We have evaluated the presence of Diasporus diastema (Cope, 1875) in eastern Panama by comparing morphological, genetic, and bioacoustic characters of specimens from near the type locality in central Panama with specimens from eastern Panama. We further describe and compare male advertisement calls of most Diasporus species. The phylogeographic analysis suggests the allopatric speciation of Diasporus species in eastern Panama following the completion of the Panamanian isthmus in the middle Miocene. Subsequent geological events concur with the vicariant evolution of different lineages in situ, suggesting eastern Panama to be a centre of endemism for this group of frogs. We present an integrative analysis of the species from eastern Panama and include an identification key for all species of the genus.","Collection permits in 2009 (SC/A-8-09, SC/A-28-09) and 2011 (SC/A-37-11), 2012 (SC/A-33-12), and exportation permits in 2012 (SC/A-33-12) and 2013 (SEX/A-7-13), were provided by ANAM, Panama, and T.Quintana (Cacique General del área de Sambú) from the ‘despacho del cacique Regional’ Comarca Emberá-Wounaan, Panama.

We discuss the methodological dimensions of participatory approaches that create conditions for eliciting people's visions and their role in a world of imposed and overwhelming globalization. In establishing broader platforms for social action, we deal with complex processes and outcomes such as self awareness, self esteem and gaining autonomy. In so doing, we want to contribute to the ‘reenchantment of the world.’ The convergence of PRA and PAR produces an intercultural learning process, which creates the conditions for the post-development era focussing on the utopias of the people.",,,Culture and Organization,,,,1998-09,1998,,1998-09,4,2,169-186,Closed,Article,"Salas, Maruja; Tillmann, Timmi","Salas, Maruja (Gomaringerstr 6, Gomaringen, D-72810, Germany); Tillmann, Timmi (Gomaringerstr 6, Gomaringen, D-72810, Germany)",,"Salas, Maruja (Gomaringerstr 6, Gomaringen, D-72810, Germany); Tillmann, Timmi (Gomaringerstr 6, Gomaringen, D-72810, Germany)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032157913,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

670,pub.1041456639,10.1639/0007-2745-114.1.102,,,Molecular and morphological evidence for distinct species in Dumortiera (Dumortieraceae),"Contemporary taxonomists usually recognize a single species in Dumortiera, which is widely distributed through tropical and subtropical regions and extends into some temperate regions. Two subspecies, D. hirsuta subsp hirsuta and subsp. nepalensis, may be recognized, and both of these were thought to occur in Central America. We sequenced four loci, the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region ITS, and three chloroplast loci (rbcL, psbA-trnH and rpoC1) from 50 samples of Dumortiera across its geographic range to test for phylogenetic structure within the species and its congruence to morphological and geographic patterns. We also used light and scanning electron microscopy to examine morphological differences between accessions from Central America. Phylogenetic inferences reveal two highly distinct lineages: the first apparently restricted to Central America, and the second distributed across all the geographic regions sampled. This widespread lineage could itself be subdivided into several genetically and geographically distinct clades. The restricted Central American lineage contains plants that have a light green velvety appearance, due to an abundance of papillae on their upper thallus surface. These can therefore be distinguished morphologically from sympatric accessions of the widespread lineage, which are dark green, with a wide range of papillae densities (absent, few or abundant) on the thallus and usually with abundant marginal hairs. However, the wider application of these characters to lineages outside the Central American region has not yet been confirmed. We conclude that Dumortiera contains at least two, if not more, distinct species. The Asian epithet nepalensis does not seem applicable to plants in Central America, as the papillate morphotypes to which this name has been applied form an exclusively new world lineage. A thorough morphological revision of the genus, and reinvestigation of type material, is required.","We are grateful to the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, University of Helsinki and National Science Foundation grant EF0531557 to Bernard Goffinet for financial support for field collection, morphological research and molecular sequencing.

The organization of a police force in the forties and of the National Guard afterwards gave it back the monopoly of force, still influenced by the U.S authority.

Unfortunately, the type material kept at the Botanical Museum of Berlin-Dahlem (B) was destroyed in the bombing of Berlin, Germany, in 1943. To complete the typification of names proposed by Schlechter, based on orchid collections attributed to Guillermo Acosta in Costa Rica, we have compiled a list of 22 names. Previously, 11 lectotypifications and five neotypifications were proposed on this material. However, we found six names that lacked typification. Therefore, formal typifications are proposed for Acostaea pleurothalloides, Dichaea similis, Goodyera micrantha, Lepanthes acostae, L. pubilabia, and Stelis acostae.

Finally, we provide bibliographical references and illustrations for lectotypes and neotypes.

661,pub.1143331696,10.1093/biolinnean/blab161,,,Geodispersal of the Typical Neotropical cenocron from South America to the Mexican Transition Zone: a cladistic biogeographical test,"Abstract Analysis of the biotic assembly of the Mexican Transition Zone (MTZ) is challenging because of the convergence of taxa with different origins and biogeographical histories. The typical Neotropical cenocron corresponds to genera widespread in South America that might have dispersed to the MTZ in the Pliocene–Holocene. It has been exemplified with distributional patterns of several plant and animal taxa; however, their historical congruence has not been tested. We examined the historical relationships among the areas of endemism where Typical Neotropical taxa are found through a cladistic biogeographical analysis to determine whether they have dispersed simultaneously, showing a geodispersal pattern. We searched for Neotropical clades that dispersed to the MTZ from the Pliocene to the present. The distribution of nine animal clades in seven areas of endemism was analysed by cladistic biogeography. Redundant areas and widespread taxa were treated with paralogy-free and transparent methods. Patterns of area relationships were searched using a parsimony analysis of paralogy-free subtrees. The parsimony analysis found a single resolved tree showing a general pattern of area relationships: (Chacoan ((South Brazilian (Boreal Brazilian + Lesser Antilles)), (South American Pacific (Mesoamerican-Central America + Western Mexico)))). Distributional and phylogenetic information on the groups analysed contrast with a previous cladistic biogeographical analysis that has shown different area relationships, thus supporting the general hypothesis of a geodispersal event of the Typical Neotropical cenocron in the MTZ. Additionally, the analysis provided evidence of vicariant events related to the lifting of the Northern Andes and climatic changes during the Pleistocene.",We thank Jen-Pan Huang for providing the locality data set for the genus Dynastes and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions.

It fringes the largest continental shelf in Central America. Since Jameson, Trott, Marshall, and Childress (2000) in Seas at the Millennium, much has changed. Despite deforestation, there are still large tracts of rainforest. Development has been hampered by a lack of infrastructure, although this is changing rapidly. New roads have expanded the market for seafood products. Since the 1990s, the volume of fisheries exports has steadily increased. Spiny lobster is now the largest export, with an export value roughly four to six times greater than fin fish. Shrimp is the third-highest volume fishery but the volume of shrimp exported has declined since 2011. The marine habitats of the Corn Islands, Pearl Cays, Miskito Cays, and coastal lagoons are used by local communities for fisheries particularly, finfish, shrimp, lobster, and green turtle. Overexploitation due to a lack of management and absence of alternative livelihoods continues to threaten these fisheries. Degradation of coral reefs and mangroves compound the threat to coastal fisheries, along with the chronic effects of climate change. The Caribbean Coast is especially vulnerable to effects of climate change. Sea-level rise, more extreme weather events and variable seasonal changes are likely to affect agricultural productivity, water resources, coastal flooding, and ecological integrity. Nicaragua has been affected by climate change over the period from 1995 to 2014. Modeling projections indicate that the situation is likely to get worse with up to 10% decrease in precipitation on the Atlantic Coast over the next 20years. The Nicaraguan government is actively addressing this with the development of the National Climate Change Action Plan in 2007 and 2010, partnering with international donors and, in 2017, it became one of the last countries to join the Paris Climate Agreement.",This chapter is dedicated to the memory of Katherine B.

A sacred plant for the Kichwa indigenous communities labelled Ilex guayusa Loes. (Aquifoliceae) is used as a case study. Twelve recorded interviews with different stakeholders of the Amazon region of Napo in Ecuador were analysed. The results of this qualitative research show that the Western-based theory on niche tourism based on experiential and intimacy theory is compatible with four principles which are related to the cosmovision (worldview) of Kichwa indigenous groups, namely: mutual learning, empowerment, regulated access to intellectual property and community legislation. The framework proposed seems suitable to understand food tourism in an indigenous setting. Furthermore, the integration of Western-based food tourism with an indigenous cosmovision might contribute to a more sustainable land use and more equitable social development.","Katia Laura Sidali acknowledges the seed research grant of Ikiam, Regional University of Amazon for conducting the interviews in the frame of the project: “Value creation along the agroindustrial chain of Ilex guayusa Loes.: feasibility study of protection as a denomination of origin and further uses in food and non-food markets” of which she is project leader and the co-authors are team members.

654,pub.1101223588,10.1007/s10336-018-1540-5,,,Molecular and climate data reveal expansion and genetic differentiation of Mexican Violet-ear Colibri thalassinus thalassinus (Aves: Trochilidae) populations separated by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,"The present day distribution and spatial genetic diversity of Mesoamerican biota reflect a long history of responses to complex topography, geological history and climate changes. The hummingbird Colibri thalassinus thalassinus is distributed in northern Mesoamerica, with geographically disjunct populations mainly separated by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (IT). Based on sampling across the species range in Mexico, we use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and distributional projections derived from ecological niche modeling (ENM) to test whether (1) populations are genetically differentiated according to the fragmented distribution of C. thalassinus thalassinus in Mexico, and (2) historical demographic patterns of these hummingbird populations correspond to those of expanded populations during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Analysis of genetic variation revealed two main mtDNA lineages: populations west of the IT along the Sierra Madre Oriental, Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Sierra Madre del Sur and populations east of the isthmus in Chiapas and Guatemala. A significant signal of genetic differentiation, demographic expansion near the LGM, and contractions/expansions of suitable environmental conditions during the LGM fit a model of lineage divergence west of the isthmus after the LGM, and that the species’ suitable habitat was continuous connecting populations on either side of the isthmus. We conclude that the genetic differentiation of C. thalassinus thalassinus in Mexico resulted from recent geographical isolation of populations separated by the IT. In addition, this scenario is supported by the modeled paleodistribution that suggests that populations expanded during the LGM, and that the spread of the species into the highlands caused habitat fragmentation and population isolation for C. thalassinus thalassinus during the interglacial periods. The findings corroborate the profound effects of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations on the genetic differentiation of C. thalassinus thalassinus in Mexico but challenge the generality of glacial refugia.","We thank C.

Lectotypes are designated for the following three species: Selenops marginalis F. O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1900 (♂), Selenops morosus Banks, 1898 (♂), and Selenops mexicanus Keyserling, 1880 (♀). The female neotype is designated for Selenops aissus Walckenaer, 1837. The males of Selenops bani Alayón-García, 1992 and Selenops marcanoi Alayón-García, 1992 are described for the first time, and the females of Selenops phaselus Muma, 1953 and Selenops geraldinae Corronca, 1996 are described for the first time. Almost all species are redescribed, barring Cuban endemics and a few species recently described. New illustrations are provided, including those of the internal female copulatory organs, many of which are illustrated for the first time. A key to species is also provided as are new distributional records.","The author acknowledges the following people and institutions for helping with loans, permits, obtaining specimens and collecting: American Museum of Natural History – Norman I.

However, accessing the remote locations in which most remaining forests of conservation value occur makes it difficult to quantify deforestation trends and to galvanize preventive action. Using remotely sensed images we were able to quantify rates of forest loss in La Amistad Biosphere Reserve, Panama. Annual deforestation rates were low between 1987 and 1998 at 0.05% but increased nearly 12-fold between 1998 and 2001 to 0.6%. Net forest loss was 0.56% between 1987 and 1998 and 2.34% between 1998 and 2001. Deforestation rates differed significantly between protected areas. Protected areas on the Caribbean side of the Biosphere Reserve experienced greater levels of deforestation than those on the Pacific, even though both absolute and percent forest cover are higher on the Caribbean. Most forest conversion was for cattle pasture and an area of industrial cattle ranching was identified within the Palo Seco and PILA protected areas as a priority for enforcement activities. Forest conversion to pasture was highly correlated with proximity to roads, rivers, and villages (p < 0.001). The spatial scale of correlation varied between feature types, suggesting a greater area of impact from roads and towns versus rivers. The acceleration of forest conversion from 1998 to 2001 confirms the negative ecological impact of the recent increase in population and development pressure in this previously isolated region.",,,Journal of Sustainable Forestry,,,,2006-05-10,2006,,2006-05-10,22,1-2,49-71,Closed,Article,"Forrestel, Alison; Peay, Kabir G.","Forrestel, Alison (National Park Service Pacific Land Resources Program, 1111 Jackson Street, Suite 700, Oakland, CA, 94607, USA); Peay, Kabir G.

These direct-developing frogs inhabit tropical regions of Mexico and northern Central America. Characterizing diversity within the group has been difficult due to high levels of phenotypic polymorphism within and between species. Because of these polymorphisms, each taxon has junior synonyms. Using a fragment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we investigated genetic diversity in the C. rhodopis Species Group. We then examined type specimens (including types of junior synonyms) to match nomenclature to geographically circumscribed genetic clusters. Our molecular analyses revealed four major lineages within the C. rhodopis Species Group: (1) a widely distributed clade in western Mexico, (2) a highland clade in eastern Mexico, (3) a widely distributed lowland clade occurring in eastern Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, and (4) a haplotype from Volcán San Martín in Veracruz, Mexico. We identified the first clade as C. occidentalis, a taxon currently placed in the ecologically similar but phylogenetically distant C. mexicanus Species Series. In light of this we place C. occidentalis in the C. rhodopis Species Group and designate a lectotype and paralectotype for the species. The second and third clades inhabiting eastern Mexico and northern Central America correspond to C. rhodopis and C. loki, respectively. Additionally, we examined the taxonomic distribution of certain colour pattern traits and compensatory mutations in Domain III of the mtDNA 12S ribosomal RNA gene. Our recovery of the divergent Veracruz haplotype and extensive mtDNA structure within species indicates that additional taxonomic revision will be necessary.","We thank the following individuals (and their respective institutions) for allowing access to specimens in their care: A.

639,pub.1067853667,10.15517/lank.v0i0.12019,,,Orchids and orchidology in Central America. 500 years of history,"The idea for this book was proposed by Dr. Joseph Arditti during the 1st. International Conference on Neotropical Orchidology that was held in San José, Costa Rica, in May 2003. In its first chapters, this is without doubt a history of orchids , relating the role they played in the life of our ancient indigenous people and later in that of the Spanish conquerors, and the ornamental, medicinal and economical uses they gave to these plants. It is not until the late XVIII century, but above all in the XIX century that we can talk about a history of orchidology , with the development of botanical science and the establishment of the bases of modern orchidology by Lindley. But the XIX century was also the time of legendary commercial collectors who, frequently with the complicity of men of science, collected with a frenzy often bordering on madness. Orchid knowledge became sometimes a synonym of orchid destruction. During the second half of the XX century the world developed a growing conscience of the negative impact of man on his natural habitat and I would like to believe that, in the future, orchidology will devote itself in an increasing manner to the study of orchids as a means to preserve them. Motivated by this belief, I decided to write this history, that will be more a story about orchids and men than a story about orchids and science, hoping that mankind will rediscover the harmonious relation with nature that characterized the life of the first inhabitants of our region. The great naturalist Alexander F. Skutch, who chose a life of study and contemplation amidst the forests of southern Costa Rica, expressed it in much better words: “Sometimes, before leaving the hilltop, I visit the old Indian burial ground. Despite promises of golden ornaments, I have never permitted anyone to excavate these graves, for I believe that we should treat the burials of alien races with the same respect that we desire for our own. Sometimes, in a meditative mood, I ask myself whether, from the moral standpoint, my title to this land is as valid as that of the men whose dust lies beneath the red clay. Perhaps the only answer to this perplexing question is that he most deserves to have the land who makes the best use of it. If my love of the mountains and rivers and forests is greater than theirs, if these things speak more meaningfully to me and I am more keenly appreciative of their beauty; if I strive harder to preserve this natural setting in its pristine splendor and to conserve the soil’s fertility — then perhaps I can justify my possession of this land that once belonged to them. If I fall short of the aborigines in these respects, then I — and the whole line of too-aggressive palefaces who transmitted to me what was once theirs — are but piratical intruders, whose right to this land would be hard to defend. Enlarging on this theme, it seems to me that, unless evolution miscarries, the ultimate possessor of the earth will be the race that most appreciates its grandeur and beauty and cherishes it most carefully, that rules it as a generous and compassionate lord instead of raping it like a greedy tyrant, as men have all too commonly done” (Skutch, 1971: 223-224).",,,Lankesteriana,,,,2013-09-30,2013,2013-09-30,,0,0,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ossenbach, Carlos","Ossenbach, Carlos (Centro de Investigación en Orquídeas de los Andes ""Ángel Andreetta"", Universidad Alfredo Pérez Guerrero, Ecuador.

634,pub.1168627134,10.1016/j.seares.2024.102478,,,Predicting functional indices in Asteroidea and Echinoidea assemblages of the Mexican Pacific from measures of structural and taxonomic diversity,"Useful indicators of anthropogenic impacts on the function and structure of marine communities are needed. Traditionally, changes in marine biodiversity have been evaluated using ecological indices such as species richness and evenness. However, these indices overlook potential ecological differences. Indeed, these differences are more accurately reflected using functional diversity, which is likely more representative of key ecosystem processes, including resilience and resistance. However, calculating functional diversity is complex due to a lack of available information on the natural history of many marine species. To address this problem, we used the information on Echinoidea and Asteroidea in the Mexican Pacific to examine the relationship between the Rao's quadratic entropy index (FDQ), a commonly used functional diversity index, and indicators of community and taxonomic structure: richness (S), abundance (N), Shannon-Wiener diversity (H′), Pielou evenness (J'), taxonomic distinctness (Δ*), and average taxonomic distinctness (Δ+). We generated a set of equations to determine if these commonly used indices could be used as proximal indicators of FDQ. We obtained good correlations between functional diversity and structural diversity, although the significant correlations were between FDQ and J' (r = 0.975) and H′ (r = 0.965). These two ecological indices are very good indirect indicators of the local functional diversity of Echinoidea and Asteroidea in the Mexican Pacific and can be used as simple, inexpensive, and powerful tools to assess the complex effects of human-induced or natural perturbations in rocky reef ecosystems.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Nevertheless, after the first waves of human immigration at the end of the Pleistocene, contact between the native peoples who remained on this isthmus and other peoples living in continental areas where civilization ultimately developed, is characterized, according to the field record, by the transfer of crops, technologies, and goods, until ca.1400 BP when speakers of Mesoamerican languages occupied the northwestern edge (Gran Nicoya). The ancestors of modern-day speakers of Chibchan and Chocoan languages underwent social and cultural diversification mostly within the confines of the land bridge. Some Precolumbian residents altered vegetation immediately after first arrival at least 11,000 years ago, and began to add domesticated crops to their subsistence inventory between 9000 and 7000 BP. Maize and manioc (or cassava), domesticated outside the land bridge, were introduced in Preceramic times, early in the period between 7000 and 4500 BP, and gradually dominated regional agriculture as they became more productive, and as human populations increased and spread into virgin areas. Diversity in material culture is visible ca. 6000 BP, and becomes more apparent after the introduction of pottery ca. 4500 BP. By 2000 BP culture areas with distinctive artifact inventories are discernible. Between 2500 and 1300 BP hierarchies among regions, sites, social groups, and individuals point to the establishment of chiefdoms whose elite members came to demand large numbers of costume and sumptuary goods. A few special centers with stone sculptures and low-scale architecture served a social universe larger than the chiefdom, such as clusters of recently fissioned social groups with memories of a common heritage. Social interactions on the land bridge, endowed with productive bottomlands, highland valleys, and coastal habitats, appear always to have been strongest among neighboring groups.",,,Journal of Archaeological Research,,,,2005-06,2005,,2005-06,13,2,129-187,Closed,Article,"Cooke, Richard","Cooke, Richard (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Unit 0948, APO AA 34002, Panama)","Cooke, Richard (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute)","Cooke, Richard (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute)",77,5,,38.84,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015925046,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

Observations of Pocillopora effusus, Pocillopora inflata, Porites lobata, Pavona clavus, and Pavona varians expanded the species known geographic ranges by several degrees of latitude, suggesting reef building fauna comprised a mixture of widespread and relatively rare Eastern Pacific corals. Results indicated greater live coral cover in the Ixtapa‐Zihuatanejo area (15–73%) than in the Acapulco localities, which had high algal dominance; the reefs in the latter region exhibited high erosion. Regional differences are likely the result of long‐standing anthropogenic pressures around Acapulco since 1950, when it became an important tourist destination. This paper is the first detailed report of ecologically stressed corals and coral reefs from the state of Guerrero on the Mexican Southern Pacific coast.",This work was partially funded by CONACYT‐SEMARNAT (projects 0189 and 023390 to L.E.C.A.) and CONABIO (project HJ029 to R.A.L.P.).

We analysed distributional data of 434 species and 72 genera of the world obtained from specialized literature and records in 12 malacological collections. We constructed the individual tracks for the species analysed and superimposed them, applying a parsimony analysis of endemicity with progressive character elimination. We identified 26 generalized tracks, extending in the Pacific Ocean (14), Indian Ocean (six), Atlantic Ocean (four), Mediterranean Sea (one) and Atlantic–Pacific Oceans (one). The generalized tracks show the complex relationships of the mollusc biota, representing geographical and phylogenetic boundaries of taxa with diverse geographical affinities. Five panbiogeographical nodes were identified by the intersection of two or more generalized tracks. Our analysis offers an approximation for understanding the distributional patterns of vetigastropod species worldwide from the perspective of evolutionary or historical biogeography. The results obtained for the Vetigastropoda coincide completely or in part with those previously presented for other taxa. The generalized tracks support hypotheses of primary biogeographical homology that might be corroborated by evidence from other different, phylogenetically unrelated taxa.","We thank the Programa de Posgrado en Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACyT) for support given to L.G.A.-E.

Presenting a New Approach to Coding Reparations","Reparations payments are commonly measured as either paid versus not paid, or present versus absent. I argue that this approach causes researchers to overlook systematic variation in the types of abuses that governments include in their reparations commitments. This article makes the case for revising quantitative reparations indicators to reflect the fact that governments often promise and/or pay reparations for some human rights violations and not others. Using original data on reparations promises for nine types of state-sanctioned human rights abuses committed during internal conflicts or dictatorships that occurred in twenty-seven countries in Europe between 1939 and 2006, I show that reparations promise rates vary by type of abuse. I also show that they vary over time as human rights norms change, meaning that a static designation of “paid” or “not paid” is incompatible with the dynamism of reparations programs.",,,Law & Social Inquiry,,,,2023-08-22,2023,2023-08-22,2024-02,49,1,90-117,Closed,Article,"Greenstein, Claire","Greenstein, Claire (Assistant Professor of Political Science in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at, the University of Alabama, at Birmingham.

We investigated the distribution of non‐flying mammals in five habitats of southern Costa Rica: relatively extensive forest (227 ha), coffee plantation, pasture, coffee with adjacent forest remnant (<35 ha), and pasture with adjacent forest remnant (<35 ha). Of the 26 native species recorded in our study plots, 9 (35%) were restricted to forest habitat, 14 (54%) occurred in both forest and agricultural habitats, and 3 (11%) were found only in agricultural habitats. Species richness and composition varied significantly with habitat type but not with distance from the extensive forest. Interestingly, small forest remnants (<35 ha) contiguous with coffee plantations did not differ from more extensive forest in species richness and were richer than other agricultural habitat types. Small remnants contiguous with pasture were species‐poor. When clearing started, the study region likely supported about 60 species. Since then, at least 6 species (10%), one family (4%), and one order (11%) have gone extinct locally. The species that disappeared were the largest in their families and included carnivorous (e.g., jaguar [Panthera onca]), herbivorous (e.g., Baird's tapir , [Tapirus bairdii]), and arboreal (e.g., mantled howler monkey [Alouatta palliata]) species. Although there is no substitute for native forest habitat, the majority of native, nonflying mammal species use countryside habitats. The populations of many persist even >5 km from relatively extensive forest, at least over the 40 years since forest clearance. Moreover, if hunting ceased, we expect that at least one of the locally extinct species could be reestablished in the existing landscape. Thus, there is an important opportunity to maintain and restore the diversity, abundance, and ecosystem roles of mammals in at least some human‐dominated regions of the Neotropics. 
   Resumen:  El futuro de la diversidad de mamíferos en los trópicos depende principalmente del valor de la conservación de tierras dominadas por actividades humanos. Investigamos la distribución de mamíferos no voladores en cinco hábitats del sur de Costa Rica: selva relativamente extensa (227 ha), plantaciones de café, pastizal, café con remanente de selva adyacente (<35 ha) y pastizal con remanente de bosque adyacente (<35 ha). De las 26 especies nativas registradas en nuestras parcelas de estudio, 9 (35%) estaban restringidas al hábitat de bosque, 14 (54%) ocurrieron tanto en hábitats de bosque como agrícolas, y 3 (11%) solo se encontraron en hábitats agrícolas. La riqueza y composición de especies varió significativamente con el tipo de hábitat pero no con la distancia al bosque extenso. Lo interesante es que las, los remanentes pequeños de bosque (<35 ha) contiguos a plantaciones de café no difirieron del bosque extenso en riqueza de especies y fueron más ricos que otros tipos de hábitat agrícolas. Los remanentes pequeños contiguos a pastizales fueron pobres en especies. Cuando comenzó la deforestación, la zona de estudio probablemente mantenía unas 60 especies. Desde entonces, por lo menos 6 especies (10%), una familia (4%) y un orden (11%) se han extinguido localmente. Las especies que desaparecieron fueron las mayores en sus familias e incluyeron especies carnívoras (por ejemplo, jaguar [Panthera onca]), herbívoras (por ejemplo, tapir, [Tapirus bairdii]) y árboricolas (por ejemplo, mono aullador [ Alouatta palliata ]). Aunque no hay sustituto para el hábitat de bosque nativo, la mayoría de las especies de mamíferos no voladores nativos utilizan hábitats rurales. Las poblaciones de muchas especies persisten aun a >5 km de bosque relativamente extenso, por lo menos en los 40 años desde la deforestación. Más aun, si cesara la cacería, esperamos que por lo menos una de las especies localmente extintas se reestablezca en el paisaje existente. Por lo tanto, hay una importante oportunidad para mantener y restaurar la diversidad, abundancia y papeles ecológicos de mamíferos en por lo menos algunas regiones dominadas por humanos en los neotrópicos .","We thank J.

617,pub.1131250785,10.1002/ppp3.10148,,,New scientific discoveries: Plants and fungi,"Societal Impact Statement   Research and publication of the planet's remaining plant and fungal species as yet unknown to science is essential if we are to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 “Life on Land” which includes the protection of terrestrial ecosystems and halting of biodiversity loss. If species are not known to science, they cannot be assessed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and so the possibility to protect them from extinction is reduced. Furthermore, until species are known to science they cannot be fully scientifically evaluated for their potential as new foods, medicines, and products which would help address SDGs 1,2,3, and 8.   Summary Scientific discovery, including naming new taxa, is important because without a scientific name, a species is invisible to science and the possibilities of researching its ecology, applications and threats, and conserving it, are greatly reduced. We review new scientific discoveries in the plant and fungal kingdoms, based largely on new names of taxa published in 2019 and indexed in the International Plant Names Index and Index Fungorum. Numbers of new species in both kingdoms were similar with 1942 new species of plant published and 1882 species of fungi. However, while >50% of plant species have likely been discovered, >90% of fungi remain unknown. This gulf likely explains the greater number of higher order taxa for fungi published in 2019: three classes, 18 orders, 48 families and 214 genera versus one new family and 87 new genera for plants. We compare the kingdoms in terms of rates of scientific discovery, globally and in different taxonomic groups and geographic areas, and with regard to the use of DNA in discovery. We review species new to science, especially those of interest to humanity as new products, and also by life‐form. We consider where future such discoveries can be expected. We recommend an urgent increase in investment in scientific discovery of plant and fungal species, while they still survive. Priorities include more investment in training taxonomists, in building and equipping collections‐based research centers for them, especially in species‐rich, income‐poor countries where the bulk of species as yet unknown to science are thought to occur.","The authors and trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Kew Foundation would like to thank the Sfumato Foundation for generously funding the State of the World&#x27;s Plants and Fungi project.

Based on the most comprehensive sampling of the group throughout its distribution in Nuclear Central America, we used data of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to assess its genetic diversity, phylogeny, and main biogeographic and diversification patterns. Our mitochondrial phylogeny only partially reflects the current taxonomy of the group, in agreement with some of the taxonomically recognized species. Specifically, our phylogenetic results show that the group is highly structured, including four main clades with genetic distances ranging from 11 to 8.6%. A remarkable level of differentiation is found at a more local level, defined as 15 different lineages with high nucleotide and haplotype diversity (π = 0.068, h = 0.99), and with divergence and genetic distance values (p‐uncorrected = 9.9–2.4%; K2P = 10.8–3.0%) similar to values observed between species within Peromyscus. Accordingly, we propose that the reference name P. mexicanus is polyphyletic and should be restricted to the mountains of central Mexico west of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. We suggest to limit the other five recognized specific names to equal number of lineages, as monophyletic, and to revalidate three junior synonyms: Peromyscus salvadorensis, P. nicaraguae and P. tropicalis. The Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Motagua‐Polochic‐Jocotán fault system, the Maya Highlands and the Honduras Depression are examples of geographic features that are likely associated with the differentiation of main lineages. Some other lineages may represent candidate species, hence the need to review the taxonomic status of the entire P. mexicanus group. The mountainous mice of the Peromyscus mexicanus group are composed of six recognized species distributed from Central México to Panamá. We report the first phylogenetic study of this group at a regional scale, showing that it is highly structured, including four main clades and 15 different lineages. Major mountains and barriers in the region are associated with the differentiation of some lineages, suggesting a role for geographic barriers and ecological features in promoting the group's high divergence and diversification.","Field permits were granted by Consejo Nacional de Áreas Protegidas in Guatemala City (Franklin Herrera and Edson Flores) and by Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales in San Salvador (Néstor Herrera).

613,pub.1090644274,10.16993/ibero.128,,,"Economic Globalization, Neo-Liberal Reformism, and Costa Rican Banana Unions’ Struggle in a Context of Regulation","This study attempts to reach an understanding of how economic globalization and neo-liberal reforms can be related to, on the one hand, the weakening of trade unions, and on the other hand, changes in the forms and objectives of trade unions’ struggles. For this purpose, the “modes of regulation”, emanating from the regulationist approach to economic development, serve as important hermeneutical tools as they provide a perspective on how economic and social dynamics vary over space and time. The study focuses on the particular development in the Costa Rican political economy during these two decades, and its relation to the setbacks and struggles of the country’s banana union movement. It is argued that economic globalization, international trade and capital liberalization sparked a switch in development from an import substitution model to a neo-liberal, export oriented model models in Costa Rica. This consequently affected the modes of regulation so as to adopt repressive features, effectively undermining banana workers’ rights to organize, to celebrate collective agreements and their freedom of association. The study claims that these repressive features of the modes of regulation are related to the setbacks of the banana unions and a subsequent reassessment of the forms and objectives of their struggles. The argument is that this reassessment can be seen as a manner to adapt trade union struggle to a new globalized world order.En este estudio se analiza el debilitamiento de los sindicatos y los cambios en las formas y objetivos de sus luchas en relación a la globalización de la economía y las reformas neo-liberales. Con este propósito se consideran los “modos de regulación” definidos de acuerdo al enfoque regulacionista del desarrollo económico. Los mismos constituyen importantes herramientas hermenéuticas ya que proporcionan una perspectiva de como el dinamismo económico-social varía en el tiempo y en el espacio. El estudio se focalize en el desarrollo político-económico de Costa Rica en las ultimas dos décadas, y en las derrotas y luchas del movimiento syndical bananero de dicho país. Se argumenta que la globalización económica incluyendo la liberalización del comercio internacional y del movimiento del capitales, produjo un cambio de modelos de desarrollo en Costa Rica. De un modelo de substitución de importaciones a uno orientado a la exportación. Esto afectó los modos de regulación los cuales adquirieron características represivas, incluyendo la efectiva cancelación de los derechos laborales de los trabajadores bananeros a organizarse colectivamente, celebrar acuerdos colectivos y afiliarse libremente. El estudio argumenta que estas características represivas se relacionan con las derrotas de los sindicatos bananeros y el subsecuente replanteamiento de las formas y objetivos de sus luchas. Esto último puede verse como una forma de adaptar la lucha sindical a un nuevo esquema mundial globalizado.",,,Iberoamericana – Nordic Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies,,,,2001-06-01,2001,2001-06-01,,31,2,9-35,All OA; Gold,Article,"Engström, Johan","Engström, Johan ()",,"Engström, Johan ()",0,0,,0.0,http://www.iberoamericana.se/articles/10.16993/ibero.128/galley/134/download/,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1090644274,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations",10 Reduced Inequalities

612,pub.1150961143,10.1002/iis2.12893,,,Social Systems Engineering for Achieving Cyber Physical‐Social System Multi‐Concern Assurance,"Abstract Novel technologies and cyber innovations applied to physical control system infrastructures such as power, water, wastewater, and dams are about to change the world, not just for short‐term profits but also for broader societal interest. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is an example of constructing one of the largest physical control system infrastructures today, creating a reservoir on the Blue Nile to supply electricity to Ethiopia and support the country's societal development. GERD has also created discord with neighboring downstream countries Egypt and Sudan, whose economies depend on the Blue Nile. Internet Protocol (IP)‐connected control systems of the GERD infrastructure make operations vulnerable to cyber failure. Uncertainty of agreement among professionals about cybersecurity and system security engineering coupled with unpredictable social and political developments and uncertainty of the technologies themselves make these systems and societies interacting with the systems more vulnerable to disruption. There are many ways advances in systems sciences and digital engineering converge with the systems engineering (SE) discipline. Such advances require cultural and systems engineering process and methodology changes to support the digital transformation of physical systems. Societal benefits and vulnerabilities to these advances illustrate the value of social systems engineering models and methodologies for measuring the uncertainty of agreement for achieving control physical‐social system multi‐concern assurance.",,,INCOSE International Symposium,,,,2022-07,2022,2022-09-13,2022-07,32,S2,30-41,Closed,Article,"Scalco, Aleksandra; Palmer, Erika","Scalco, Aleksandra (Department of Systems Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80521, USA); Palmer, Erika (Sintef Ocean, Trondheim, Norway)","Scalco, Aleksandra (Colorado State University)","Scalco, Aleksandra (Colorado State University); Palmer, Erika (SINTEF Ocean)",4,4,,2.8,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150961143,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"
608,pub.1112141936,10.1007/s12520-019-00796-6,,,Geochemical and mineralogical relations of three ceramic complexes from the formative period (2000–300 BC) in Costa Rica,"The formative period in Costa Rica (2000–300 BC) refers to the consolidation of agricultural practices, the appearance of pottery, and the beginning of a village lifestyle. In this context, ceramics are of interest as they lack fundamental surveys with analytical techniques to understand the relations among the ceramic complexes and their technology. Eighty-one ceramic samples from three complexes of the formative period in Costa Rica were analyzed with micro-destructive techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE). Information about the mineral and elemental composition was thus gathered, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) leading to hierarchical clustering in dendrograms. We explored the correlation of ceramic complexes Tronadora, Chaparrón, and La Montaña through studying their elemental composition, minerals, and geological features. Each complex was examined with a dendrogram of its elemental composition to assess the correlation of ceramic forms within the complex. Based on the association found among these ceramic forms for each complex, we suggest that the Tronadora and Chaparrón complexes had access to more than one source of raw materials. Such findings are related to the geology of the zone and the minerals discovered near each site. PCA shows a close association between Tronadora and Chaparrón with elements such as Cl and Pb, as opposed to La Montaña in which Rb, Fe, Zn, and Cu were present. Our investigation provides technical evidence for some archeological hypotheses proposed for the interaction among these three ceramic complexes.","We thank Museo Nacional de Costa Rica for the samples, the group ANDREAH, especially Dr. José Luis Ruvalcaba Sil for his contribution to obtain a fellowship for the first author and his help in making possible the analysis of the samples, and Mr. K.

This study combines the results of laboratory experiments using representative assemblage components and pitfall trapping over a large geographical area to examine the hypothesis that ongoing interspecific competition structures Neotropical dung beetle assemblages. 2. From Guatemala to Panama assemblages of large to medium‐sized, fast‐tunnelling dung beetles include a single large, nocturnal dichotomiine species, Dichotomius annae (Kohlmann & Solís, 1997). In competition experiments, this species out‐competed the medium‐sized coprine species, Copris lugubris Boheman and Phanaeus demon Laporte‐Castelnau, for dung and nesting space, in spite of earlier colonisation by the diurnal species, P. demon. 3. Differences in the abundance of D. annae at Central American sites did not affect total fast‐tunnelling dung beetle assemblage richness over the rainy season. However, D. annae rank order was directly related to the probability of interspecific encounters (Hurlbert's Δ1) among species. These trends were also observed when species lists from published and unpublished studies of other large allopatric dichotomiine species, with a more northerly distribution, were included in the analyses. 4. The results obtained suggest that where large dichotomiine species are abundant, their efficient pre‐emption of a considerable proportion of available resources drives all, or most, other fast‐tunnelling species to a lower population density, thereby decreasing assemblage diversity.",,,Ecological Entomology,,,,2005-04-07,2005,2005-04-07,2005-04,30,2,182-193,Closed,Article,"Horgan, Finbarr G.; Fuentes, René C.","Horgan, Finbarr G.

Mortoniodendron anisophyllum and M. costaricense have domatia up to the tertiary and quaternary veins. Moreover, domatia are absent in only two species, M. pentagonum and M. uxpanapense. Although there are reports on the occurrence of domatia in Malvaceae s.l., mainly in Brownlowioideae, Sterculioideae, and Tilioideae subfamilies, they are poorly described, and based on the different types of domatia found in Mortoniodendron we suggest reviewing other genera to better describe the diversity of domatia in Malvaceae s.l.","Se agradece a los curadores de los herbarios CHAPA, ENCB, LL, MEXU, TEX y XAL, por el préstamo de los ejemplares y permitirnos remover hojas para realizar el estudio; a Guadalupe Nieto de la Unidad Tapachula del Colegio de la Frontera Sur por la ayuda y su excelente trabajo en el MEB; a Monserrat Vázquez-Sánchez y Rosa Andrés Hernández por su colaboración en el trabajo de diafanización, a Lorena Ruiz-Montoya por la determinación de los ácaros y cóccidos; a Erika Pérez por la elaboración de los dibujos y a Tom Wendt por su revisión, comentarios y criticas constructivas.

603,pub.1120396015,10.1155/2019/8356712,,,Fermentation of Musa paradisiaca Peels to Produce Citric Acid,"Among organic acids, citric acid (CA) features the highest production volume and the greatest economic potential. The steadily increasing demand for CA necessitates the improvement and diversification of the corresponding production techniques via the incorporation of more environmentally friendly and less costly processes such as the bioconversion of agroindustrial by-products.
                    Musa paradisiaca
                    , known as plantain, is a food product of global importance; however, the related by-products are scarcely utilized. Herein, we investigate CA production from
                    M. paradisiaca
                    peels via fermentation with
                    Aspergillus niger
                    . Compositional analysis shows that the above peels contain 623 g·kg
                    −1
                    total carbohydrates, 374 g·kg

                    ), Fe (39 mg·kg
                    −1
                    ), Na (71 mg·kg
                    −1

                    −1
                    ), and Cu (18 mg·kg
                    −1
                    ). Evaluation of solid-substrate fermentation conditions (pH and inoculum loading) reveals that CA production is maximized (29 g·kg
                    −1
                    ) at 10% consistency, 30°C, pH 1.4, and inoculum loading = 20 mg, demonstrating that pH is the most important parameter determining fermentation efficiency. As a result,

595,pub.1047890946,10.1111/j.1095-8312.2003.00303.x,,,Molecular diversification of salamanders of the tropical American genus Bolitoglossa (Caudata: Plethodontidae) and its evolutionary and biogeographical implications,"The largest genus of salamanders, Bolitoglossa (Plethodontidae), is widespread in tropical America, where it occurs in diverse habitats and elevations, from high elevation grasslands to lowland rain forest. It has the most extensive geographical range of any salamander genus. While most species occur in Middle America, it ranges throughout most of tropical South America as well. Phylogenetic analysis of 1196 bp of two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b, 16S RNA) from 55 species offers strong support for the monophyly of the genus and sorts the species into a number of clades. Taking into account morphology, distribution, general ecology, and prior systematic and taxonomic studies, we recognize seven subgenera, four of them new: Bolitoglossa Duméril, Bibron et Duméril, 1854, Eladinea Miranda Ribeiro, 1937, Magnadigita Taylor, 1944, Mayamandra, Nanotriton, Oaxakia and Pachymandra. All South American and some lower Middle American species are included in a single well -supported clade, Eladinea. At the species level our analyses uncover the existence of large genetic diversity within morphologically homogeneous taxa. We propose the new combination: B. (Eladinea) paraensis (Unterstein, 1930) stat. nov., for Brazilian salamanders previously included under B. altamazonica. We evaluate evidence for the multiple colonization of the tropical lowlands by morphologically derived species groups. South America was invaded by members of one clade, Eladinea, which we infer to have dispersed to South America prior to closure of the Panamanian Portal. Despite the relatively long history of salamanders in South America, that continent now accounts for a relatively small proportion of the lineages and species of neotropical salamanders.","We thank T.

The government marketing authority purchases sufficient rice to support the established price level and stores or exports the surplus. Although producers benefit, this policy imposes significant costs on consumers, government expenditures and economic efficiency. One policy recommendation is to bring domestic prices in line with the international level. Although free trade is one possibility, a market stabilization programme could be retained. At a minimum Panama's rice price should reflect domestic demand and not production costs. The unfavourable rice-fertilizer price ratio also deserves attention.",,,Food Policy,,,,1985-11,1985,,1985-11,10,4,352-364,Closed,Article,"Senauer, Benjamin","Senauer, Benjamin ()",,"Senauer, Benjamin ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046056811,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics,

Part I: Anomura and Brachyura,"Our knowledge of fossil crustaceans from the tropics has increased considerably during recent decades, thanks to novel findings and the re-examination of museum specimens. However, several previous records have been misidentified, numerous museum specimens have never been reported, and many new discoveries are yet to be published. Here, we present a detailed, up-to-date, and revised checklist for every marine, terrestrial, or freshwater fossil decapod crustacean occurrence from tropical America known to us, including their age, geographic occurrences, and related literature. We recognize the occurrence of at least 32 superfamilies, 69 families, 190 genera, and 415 species of brachyurans (‘true’ crabs), and anomurans (‘false’ crabs, hermit crabs, squat lobsters, and allies), several of them previously unknown. The checklist comprises records from three main geographic regions: 1) northern South America (Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela); 2) Central America and southern North America (Belize, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Mexico, southern and central Florida); and 3) the Caribbean Islands + Bermuda (Anguilla, Antigua, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Bonaire, Cuba, Curaçao, Dominican Republic, The Grenadines, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Saint Bartélemy, Saint Martin, Trinidad). Previous findings, new occurrences, and the revised systematic placement for several problematic/misidentified records, indicate that the fossil record of anomurans and brachyurans in tropical America is more diverse than previously envisioned, with a considerable degree of endemism at the genus- and species-levels.","JL thanks Carlos Jaramillo (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panamá) and A.

Its growth model is characterised by a dual economy in which a small number of activities, including those related to the Canal and Special Economic Zones, have exhibited high productivity growth but limited job creation.Panama should now embark on a new reform agenda to become a sustainable and inclusive high-income country. This report urges greater productivity in sectors that contribute to job formalisation to reduce disparities in income and among regions. As developing these policies requires further resources, taxation system and private sector involvement through public-private partnerships should also be reinforced.

(Rubiaceae),"We examined 532 specimens representing eight species of Didymaea (Rubiaceae) to describe their leaf architecture. Characters observed in the herbarium specimens and cleared leaves were leaf base, apex, and margin; trichome type and distribution; vein orders from primary to higher order veins, veinlets, and ultimate marginal vein. Six morphometric variables were analyzed using variance and principal component analysis to identify which characters are useful to distinguish species. Most of the species present brochidodromous venation pattern, except D. hispidula, which has eucamptodromous venation pattern; Didymaeafloribunda is unique in having cylindrical and bicellular trichomes. Principal component analysis revealed that 78% of the total variation is mainly related to leaf maximum width. Variance analysis showed significant differences between D. microflosculosa and the other species. Architectural features were useful for differentiating all the species, and an identification key for the species of Didymaea based only on leaf characters is presented.",,,Plant Systematics and Evolution,,,,2009-06-17,2009,2009-06-17,2009-08,281,1-4,137-149,Closed,Article,"Pacheco-Trejo, Jaime; Terrazas, Teresa; Ochoterena, Helga","Pacheco-Trejo, Jaime (División de Posgrado, Instituto de Ecología A.

Tourism development and infrastructure are also important forces behind new processes of land acquisition. Examining land grabbing in Central America allows us to move beyond single-cause explanations of land grabs and shows that it is a complicated and multi-actor process occurring at many scales. Contemporary processes of land acquisition and land re-concentration in Central America are embedded in a historical continuum of indigenous dispossession by colonial powers, later by international corporations and more recently by a combination of domestic and international capital in which the domestic landed elites play an important role. Even when the size of scale of land acquisitions is smaller compared with other parts of the world, new processes of land deals in Central America impact thousands of peasant livelihoods. These impacts are related both to changing property to land and to grabbing control over resources with implications for among other things, food security, human health, employment conditions and taxes, resulting in violent agrarian conflicts. Future research on land grabbing in Central America should focus on how drug trafficking interacts with land deals, the role of domestic elites in mining deals, the legal, illegal and quasi-legal instances in which the State operates in alliance with corporations, private security forces and the military.","Thanks to Luis Solano, Cecilie Hirsch and Matthew J.

C. y 1502 d.C.,"The theme presented addresses the settlement of the Nicaraguan South Caribbean region and the evolution of the societies that settled there during pre-Hispanic times, which contributed to the Caribbean regional conformation. The gradual transformation of a thriving region with very complex societies, with territorial dominance, large settlements, local developments and regional links, to a region with societies that enter a process of territorial abandonment is examined, from the arrival of the Mesoamerican peoples and later with the Spanish. A theoretical-methodological proposal is made for the case study, from the inter and trans-disciplinarity, which contributes to the development of a study model that, with an initial archaeological base, can be applied to other Nicaraguan regions. Therefore, it contributes to the regional history of the great Caribbean region, specifically that of the south, and to the national one, being the most differentiated of the great Nicaraguan regions. The migratory currents that influenced the settlement of this historical region, the material evidence and settlement patterns that occurred there, the relationship with the environment, daily life, economy, funeral practices and regional links during the long process of regional conformation that took place.

This study describes an integrative analysis of the biogeographical affinities of the biota inhabiting the islands. A biotic component analysis showed a close relationship between the islands and the Pacific Lowlands and Veracruzan biogeographical provinces, whereas a cladistic biogeographical analysis additionally showed a Nearctic affinity with the Sonoran biogeographical province. The biogeographical affinity patterns, based on the distribution of the sister group of each endemic species, revealed three distinct patterns: Neotropical, Sonoran-Neotropical and Nearctic-Neotropical. The study recognized that the Tres Marías Islands are a region of great biological complexity where the biota of the Pacific Lowlands and the Veracruzan provinces intersect, with a predominantly Neotropical affinity. In this biogeographical analysis, information on the biotic assemblage and the geological history of the Tres Marías Islands are integrated and discussed. The biotic assembly of the islands must have occurred via both vicariance and dispersal at different geological times, related to opening of the Gulf of California (Miocene–Pleistocene) as well as to periods of glaciation (Pleistocene).","P.G.G.N. thanks the Posgrado en Ciencias Biológicas of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) for academic training and logistical support, and Isvi E.

576,pub.1039338040,10.1505/ifor.10.3.485,,,The Prospects for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) in Mesoamerica,"The general reluctance of policy makers to include forests in discussions about global warming has changed with the development of measures to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD). Mesoamerica presents a logical starting point to promote REDD due to the extent of its forest, and the relatively advanced state of its forest management institutions and policies. This paper reviews the prospects for REDD in Mesoamerica using PES and other instruments, with emphasis on the effectiveness of REDD measures at reducing emissions, and their efficiency and fairness. It concludes that in spite of reduced deforestation in the region, the growth of payments to avoid deforestation will be the most important policy change related to REDD in the region in the coming years. However, the magnitude and impact of any payments must not be exaggerated and should be set in context of the overall trends resulting from broader social and economic dynamics.",,,International Forestry Review,,,,2008-09-01,2008,,2008-09-01,10,3,485-495,All OA; Green,Article,"Kaimowitz, D.","Kaimowitz, D.

MacDougal & Feuillet (Passifloraceae),"PassiflorasubgenusDecalobasupersectionCieca is a monophyletic group of herbaceous to woody climbers found in subtropical and tropical regions of the world. The 19 species recognized here are primarily distributed in the southern United States, Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Two species, Passiflorasuberosa and Passiflorapallida, are also naturalized in various regions of the Old World. The species of the supersection are recognized by their small, apetalous, usually greenish flowers with the filaments of the corona mostly in two series. The plants commonly lack c-glycosylflavones but possess flavonol 3-O-glycosides. The supersection contains two problematic species complexes, Passiflorasuberosa and Passifloracoriacea. Phylogenetic relationships within supersection Cieca are investigated by means of phenetic and cladistic analyses of morphological and molecular (ITS 1 & 2) characters. The morphological and molecular data sets were analyzed separately because of incongruity due to taxon sampling and the complicated evolutionary history of entities within the Passiflorasuberosa complex. All analyses confirm the monophyly of the supersection. They also show that the Passiflorasuberosa complex is a non-monophyletic group of cryptic species, and inter-taxic hybridization and polyploidy have contributed to the confusing and complex pattern of variation evident within the group. Four taxa that were formerly included in this complex are recognized: Passiflorapallida, Passiflorasuberosasubsp.suberosa, Passiflorasuberosasubsp.litoralis, and Passifloratridactylites. On the basis of molecular and morphological data, three species from the Passifloracoriacea complex are recognized: Passifloracoriacea, Passiflorasexocellata, and Passifloramegacoriacea. A key, detailed descriptions, distribution maps, and illustrations are included in the revision. Pollination, dispersal, and herbivory of the group are reviewed. The distribution and ecology of the species within the supersection are also discussed.","This study was supported by grants from the National Science Foundataion (Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant, DEB-0104824), the American Society of Plant Taxonomists (Research Grants for Graduate Students), the Passiflora Society International (Graduate Research Award), Sigma Xi (Grant-in-Aid of Research), and the Haitian Resource Development Foundation (Travel Award).

The main goal of this study is to describe and compare the leaf architecture and the anatomy of 11 species of Mortoniodendron using cleared leaves and paradermal and transverse leaf sections. All of the species of Mortoniodendron share a simple lamina with an entire margin. The differences among the species include the venation pattern, the relative thickness and course of the secondary veins, the presence or absence of the intersecondary veins, the tertiary vein pattern, the number of branches in veinlets, and the marginal ultimate venation. The leaf anatomy is similar to other species of the Malvaceae s.l.: for example, mucilage cells are common in Mortoniodendron. There are unique attributes of the leaf architecture and anatomy, such as the eucamptodromous venation pattern of M. guatemalense, which facilitates the identification of the species.

It analyses the macroeconomic conditions underlying the rise in income per capita and the shifts in productivity over the past decade, as well as the uneven growth of labour productivity across economic sectors and regions. The analysis further looks at Panama’s export profile, which concentrates on services exports, and assesses the exports’ value-added and the contribution of services to other exports. The chapter also presents the impact of foreign direct investment on specific economic sectors and its important contribution to total investment.

The BRI is being welcomed across the region, not as a foreign project, but as a vehicle through which to realize its own dream of integrated development, eliminating poverty in the process. This chapter reviews how and in what way the BRI has developed into a political and economic force in this region, and its prospects going forward. Two proposed great projects, in particular—South America’s bioceanic railroad and a railroad connecting the continents of North and South America through Central America—are examined, to illustrate the interplay of history and current forces shaping the direction of this unique endeavor in the region. Also addressed are the prospects for transforming the Caribbean Basin into a logistics and manufacturing center on the cross-Atlantic Maritime Silk Road, and little-discussed proposals for connecting the Americas by land to the Belt and Road rail lines through Eurasia, through a Bering Strait tunnel. For well-known reasons of history and geography, the arrival of the Belt and Road in Latin America and the Caribbean cannot be discussed without posing the question of whether or not the United States will join this new emerging international geometry.",,,,The Belt and Road Initiative,"Francisco José B.

Sometimes termed a “cholo guerrillero”, Lorenzo led Indigenous peoples into battle in alliance with the liberals against the conservatives who had taken power in Colombia. Lorenzo’s actions provide an example of the complicated relationships that Indigenous leaders sought to negotiate with liberals in Latin America at the turn of the twentieth century. Observers have long debated whether a political ideology motivated Lorenzo’s involvement with the liberals, and whether he can best be understood as a caudillo, nationalist, or socialist. An examination of his attitudes toward ethnic identities and women’s involvement in his struggle reveals that the actions of marginalized peoples were a primary factor that informed his political engagement. Victoriano Lorenzo est le seul général panamien à avoir été exécuté en raison de son rôle dans la Guerre de Mille Jours (1889–1902) en Grande Colombie. Lorenzo, qui fait partie de ceux que l’on appelle parfois les ‘guerrillero cholo’, a entraîné les peuples indigènes dans la lutte, menée aux côtés des libéraux, contre les conservateurs qui avaient pris le pouvoir en Colombie. Les actes de Lorenzo nous offrent un exemple des relations complexes que les chefs indigènes cherchaient à négocier avec les libéraux en Amérique Latine au début du vingtième siècle. Les observateurs ont longtemps débattu pour déterminer si l’engagement de Lorenzo aux côtés des libéraux était l’effet d’une idéologie politique, ou bien s’il faut voir en lui un caudillo, un nationaliste, ou un socialiste.

The complex has been the source of ongoing taxonomic debate. To evaluate phenotypic variation in the House Wren complex, we collected 81,182 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from restriction site associated loci (RADseq) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from samples representing the taxonomic and geographic diversity of the complex. Both datasets reveal deep phylogeographic structuring, with several topological discrepancies. The trees highlight the evolutionary distinctiveness of eastern and western T. aedon, which were sister taxa in the SNP tree and paraphyletic on the mtDNA tree. The RADseq data reveal a distinct T. a. brunneicollis group, although STRUCTURE plots suggest admixture between western T. aedon and northern Mexican samples of T. a. brunneicollis. MtDNA data show a paraphyletic arrangement of T. a. musculus on the tree, whereas the SNP tree portrays them as monophyletic. Island taxa are distinct in both datasets, including T. a. beani (Isla Cozumel), which appears derived from T. a. musculus in eastern Mexico, and T. sissonii (Isla Socorro) and T. tanneri (Isla Clarión) although the 2 datasets disagree on their overall phylogenetic placement. Although we had only mtDNA data for T. a. martinicensis from the Lesser Antilles, we found at least 4 distinct and paraphyletic taxa from Trinidad, Granada, St. Vincent islands, and Dominica. The House Wren complex showed strong differentiation in mtDNA and RADseq datasets, with conflicting patterns likely arising from some combination of sex-biased dispersal, incomplete lineage sorting, or selection on mtDNA. The most glaring discrepancies between these 2 datasets, such as the paraphyly of eastern and western North American House Wrens in the mtDNA tree, present excellent opportunities for follow-up studies on evolutionary mechanisms that underpin phylogeographic patterns.","We thank V.

A new fossil pollen record from the lowland setting of El Valle, Panama, spanned the period from 137,000 to 98,000 years ago. We used multivariate analysis of modern and fossil pollen samples to provide the first regional quantification of Last Interglacial temperature and precipitation change and found mean annual temperatures were c. 1–2 °C warmer than modern, while precipitation was mostly similar to modern. The montane genus Quercus was intermittently present throughout the interglacial period, leading to the inference that this dispersal-limited taxon was surviving in microrefugia. Both charcoal and the early successional genus Cecropia were noticeably rare in the last interglacial compared with the Holocene. The modern absence of Quercus from Central Panama does not appear to be the product of interglacial warming, but rather a result of dry conditions in the late Holocene and human activity. It is suggested that humans greatly increased fire frequency, thereby favoring Cecropia and eliminating Quercus from the lower portion of its elevational range.","The Center for Tropical Paleoecology and Archaeology of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute is thanked for their logistical support.

551,pub.1166782301,10.1101/2023.12.05.570267,,,Can upwelling regions be potential thermal refugia for marine species during climate warming? The case of Mexico,"Abstract Anthropogenic climate warming will change the thermal habitats of marine species worldwide. Species are expected to migrate to higher latitudes as warming intensifies since behavioral and physiological mechanisms have been adapted to maximize fitness under a specific range of temperatures. However, given the possible intensification of upwelling ecosystems, they may act as potential thermal refugia under climate warming, which could protect the diversity of the marine ecosystems, making them important regions for marine resource management. This research aimed to predict the effects of climate warming on commercial and non-commercial marine species (vertebrate and invertebrates) reported in official Mexican documents (> 300 species) based on a thermal niche characterization with the objective to observe if the upwelling regions can act as potential thermal refugia. For this, we considered Representative Concentration Pathway (6.0 and 8.5) scenarios for the present and the future (2040-2050 and 2090-2100). Current and future patterns of suitability, species distribution, richness, and turnover were calculated via ecological niche models using the minimum volume ellipsoids as an algorithm. The results in this study highlight that beyond migration to higher latitudes, some upwelling regions (not all) could be potentially used as some type of “oasis” by marine species refuging from environmental pressure or zones of higher stability of species. Specifically, the upwelling systems in western Baja California and north of Yucatan may be essential regions for future management in Mexico. Nevertheless, it is important to note that climate change acts on numerous ecosystem features, such as trophic relationships, phenology, and other environmental variables not considered here. Future research could test our hypothesis under more realistic simulations. However, migration toward upwelling regions seems to be the most logical selection from all the available ecosystems as climate refugia for marine species beyond movement to higher latitudes or depths.",We are grateful to Diana Fischer for editorial services in English.,,bioRxiv,,,,2023-12-07,2023,2023-12-07,,,,2023.12.05.570267,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Angeles-Gonzalez, Luis Enrique; Torrejón-Magallanes, Josymar; Osorio-Olvera, Luis; Avendaño, Otilio; Díaz, Fernando; Rosas, Carlos","Angeles-Gonzalez, Luis Enrique (Laboratorio de Ecofisiología de Organismos Acuáticos, Departamento de Biotecnología Marina Centro de Investigación Científica y de Educación Superior de Ensenada, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; Cousteau Group, Lima, Peru); Torrejón-Magallanes, Josymar (Cousteau Group, Lima, Peru; Área Funcional de Dinámica Poblacional y Evaluación de Recursos Pelágicos, Instituto del Mar del Perú, Callao, Peru); Osorio-Olvera, Luis (Departamento de Ecología de la Biodiversidad, Instituto de Ecología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad Universitaria, Coyoacán.

The changes to the Panamanian security forces that ensued were in equal part a ‘demilitarisation’ process, a police reform and an (imposed) transition to democracy where the political domination of the Panamanian security forces came to an abrupt end. Deploying the concepts of demilitarisation, professionalisation and depoliticisation, the article evaluates the political role and activities of police forces and the nature of their relationship with the main Panamanian political actors through to the present Torrijos administration. It then assesses the implications for wider political processes, suggesting that explanations for the success or failure of reform are unlikely to be found in the examination of the design and implementation of the reform itself, but that broader political processes must be analysed in order to understand the dynamic that underpins it.

Los cambios a las fuerzas de seguridad panameñas que se sucedieron fueron al mismo tiempo un proceso de “desmilitarización”, una reforma policial y una transición (impuesta) hacia la democracia donde la dominación política de las fuerzas de seguridad panameñas finalizó de forma abrupta. Utilizando los conceptos de desmilitarización, profesionalización y despolitización, el artículo evalúa las actividades y el papel político de las fuerzas policiales y la naturaleza de su relación con los principales actores políticos panameños durante la administración del presidente Torrijos. Luego evalúa las implicaciones en procesos políticos más amplios, sugiriendo que las explicaciones sobre el éxito o fracaso de la reforma tienen poca posibilidad de entenderse con sólo el examen al diseño y a la implementación de las reformas mismas, sino que se deben analizar procesos políticos más amplios con el fin de entender la dinámica que los determina.

536,pub.1029099205,10.1007/978-94-017-7499-4_12,,,Coral Reef Bioerosion in the Eastern Tropical Pacific,"Bioerosion, the weakening and erosion of hard substrates by boring, etching, and grazing organisms, is a major structuring force on coral reefs of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). Bioerosional processes are the main source of reef erosion, and facilitate recycling of reefal carbonate. In healthy reefs, a dynamic balance exists between destructive (i.e. bioerosion) and constructive (i.e. bioaccretion) processes, allowing for maintenance and growth of reef frameworks. In changing environments, however, bioerosion rates can exceed those of coral calcification, leading to reduced reef development and the destruction of reef frameworks. In the ETP, high rates of bioerosion are promoted by nutrient-rich upwelling and high primary productivity conditions, recurrent coral bleaching and mortality events, and a chemical environment characterized by high-pCO2 and low aragonite saturation state. Here we examine bioerosion in ETP coral habitats and the variable roles of reef-dwelling bioeroder taxa: microbial euendoliths (microendoliths), sponges, polychaetes, sipunculans, crustaceans, molluscs, echinoids, and reef fishes. Among these agents of bioerosion, sponges, sipunculans, bivalves, and echinoderms have been relatively well studied in this region, while information is currently lacking or limited for microendolith assemblages, polychaetes and reef fishes. The frequency of coral invasion by clionaid sponges (e.g., Cliona vermifera and Thoosa mismalolli) is variable between ETP coral habitats. Dense boring sponge assemblages can lead to high rates of carbonate losses exceeding those of bioaccretion. Boring bivalves (i.e., species of Lithophaga and Gastrochaena) are very abundant on many actively accreting reefs and are generally more prominent contributors to reef erosion in the ETP than in other regions. Sea urchins are by far the most destructive grazers of coral substrates in habitats where abundant. Following ENSO-associated coral mortality events, intense bioerosion by sea urchins has impeded coral recovery and compromised reef health at many eastern Pacific sites. This chapter reviews factors important in ETP bioerosion, and current knowledge of bioeroder populations in the region.","J.J.

However, despite several perceived threats to the integrity of the freshwater habitats throughout the region, a formal analysis of extinction risk for the region’s ichthyofauna is lacking. In this manuscript, we report an updated checklist of species and a novel comprehensive assessment of the conservation status of Central American freshwater fishes by applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria to species at the global level. We also analyze the distribution of freshwater fishes across Central America and generate baseline geospatial data that can be used in multi-species conservation planning processes, which is available through the Red List Website. Our results indicate that between 15 and 28% of freshwater fishes in the region are threatened with extinction, with considerable uncertainty resulting from elevated data deficiency. We identify major and widespread threats in the region, including pollution, agriculture, aquaculture, biological resource use, natural system modifications, invasive species, and land development. This analysis represents an important first step in formulating effective conservation planning and action initiatives for a taxonomic group that historically has received few protections and can be used to inform conservation priorities of freshwater ecosystems at both national and regional scales.","We would like to thank The New Mexico BioPark Society and Center for Species Survival for generously funding an expert review workshop in December 2019 in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

A significant contribution to this knowledge, however, is also derived from the study of the history of geology of neighboring areas such as the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Some scholars have treated this theme in detail previously: Weyl [1] and Dengo [2] for the whole of Central America, Draper and Dengo [3] and Dengo [4] for the Central American-Caribbean region, Escalante [5] for southern Central America and western Colombia, and Alvarado et al.

In this paper, a generalized formula for the internal force variation of pin-jointed structures due to variation of external force, cross-sectional area, and initial length is derived. The area-loss sensitivity coefficient ( ASC) and the area-loss evenness coefficient ( AEC) based on statistical measures are then defined. By calculating these two coefficients, the influence of single member’s area-loss on the behavior of the structure as well as the evenness of internal force variation are evaluated. Besides, a method to determine the area-loss limit of pin-jointed structures is proposed based on the structural reliability theory and mathematical nonlinear programming. According to the above process, the effect of members’ area loss on structural properties is analyzed without complicated numerical approaches such as FEM, and then the safety of corroded structures is assessed preliminarily. The proposed method is verified by two numerical examples, and provides a convenient tool for pre-manufacturing, maintenance during service life, and structural health monitoring of pin-jointed structures.",,"FundingThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51878600 and 51978605) and National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0806100).",Advances in Structural Engineering,,,,2023-05-17,2023,2023-05-17,2023-07,26,10,1767-1782,Closed,Article,"Deng, Man-yu; Samy, Akram; Yuan, Xing-fei","Deng, Man-yu (College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China); Samy, Akram (College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China); Yuan, Xing-fei (College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China)","Yuan, Xing-fei (Zhejiang University)","Deng, Man-yu (Zhejiang University); Samy, Akram (Zhejiang University); Yuan, Xing-fei (Zhejiang University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158132945,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Population growth is substantial, habitats are lost and biodiversity is reduced at an alarming rate, severely affecting many ecosystem services. This situation calls for sound coastal management and the effective engagement of all relevant stakeholders. About two decades ago the M.Sc. program ISATEC (International Studies in Aquatic Tropical Ecology) was created at Bremen University (Germany) to train young scientists for a professional engagement in the complex field of tropical coastal and resource management. This book provides a platform for those Alumni to report on their work experiences and findings in their home countries and covers all regions of the tropical belt. Part I of the book provides a short review of the state of the tropical ocean and its resources and of international attempts towards sustainable ocean management starting with the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development in 1992. Part II deals with country case studies, and part III focuses on an evaluation & synopsis of those contributions. Emerging key issues for management and conservation of the tropical coastal environments are presented and critical challenges on the path towards reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are discussed, as are the needs for enhancing research and capacity development.",,,,,"Matthias Wolff, Sebastian C.A.

It identifies three main periods: English colonial rule; enclave economy when US companies were involved in a number of extractive enterprises; and, finally, control by the Sandinistas who came to power in 1979 after the overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship.
                  The Atlantic Coast has been a forgotten area of study. Only recently, because of the Miskito Indian question, has the academic world and the public at large taken more interest. The tendency nevertheless has been to focus on the treatment of the Miskito population (and especially its temporary relocation from its traditional lands) not only as the most important issue, but as the only issue. While the Miskitos have been a proper cause for concern the Miskito question is only a small aspect of a complex set of social, political, economic and ethnic relations existing on the Atlantic Coast. The Miskitos are but one of six ethnic groups living on the Atlantic Coast.",,,Journal of Latin American Studies,,,,1989-10,1989,2009-02-05,1989-10,21,3,481-520,Closed,Article,"Sollis, Peter","Sollis, Peter (Peter Sollis is Desk Officer for Central America at, Oxfam, UK.)",,"Sollis, Peter (Oxfam)",15,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025759144,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society",
